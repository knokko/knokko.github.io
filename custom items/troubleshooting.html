            When things don't work (as they should), here are some simple things to check:
            <ul>
                <li>
                    The plugins folder of your server contains 'Custom Items.jar' or 'Custom+Items.jar' 
                    (downloading it might replace the space in the name with a plus, but that's fine).
                </li>
                <li>
                    The plugins folder of your server contains a file starting with 'Knokko+Core' or 'Knokko Core'.
                </li>
                <li>
                    The plugins folder of your server contains a folder called 'CustomItems', which contains a file
                    ending with '.cis' or '.txt'.
                </li>
                <li>
                    The 'resource-pack' and 'resource-pack-sha1' in your server.properties aren't empty.
                </li>
            </ul>
            If any of the things above is missing, things are not going to work.
            If you changed anything, restart the server to test if it works now.
            If it still doesn't work, do the following checks:
            <ul>
                <li>
                    Is the CustomItems version you are using the latest released version?
                    If not, replace your current version with the latest version and restart your server.
                </li>
                <li>
                    Is your KnokkoCore version the latest for your minecraft version?
                    If not, replace it with the latest version and restart your server.
                </li>
            </ul>
            If you did everything I mentioned above, it is likely that the mistake is mine.
            In that case, please do the following steps.
            <ul>
                <li>
                    Use the '/plugins' command and check that 'CustomItems' and 'KnokkoCore' are listed.
                </li>
                <li>
                    Use the '/customitems list' command and check that it lists all your custom items.
                </li>
                <li>
                    Check your server console/log, copy it entirely, paste it in the box below and click on the 'Check console' button.
                </li>
            </ul>
            Post all results from the previous 3 steps mentioned above on the <a href="https://discordapp.com/invite/bmF3Zvu">discord</a>
