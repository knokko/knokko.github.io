        <h3>Maximum number of flying projectiles</h3>
        <p>
            The maximum number of custom projectiles that is allowed to fly at the same time. When this limit is reached,
            no more custom projectiles can be spawned until an existing custom projectile hits something or expires.
            The purpose of this limit is to prevent massive lagg when too many custom projectiles are active. (This often happens
            when a projectile effects spawns another custom projectile which in turn also has such projectile effects...)
