    </head>
    <body>
        <p>
            Exporting an item set prepares it for being used in a minecraft server. 
            In the <a href="index.html">edit menu</a>, there is an export button for each minecraft version supported by this plug-in.
            You are supposed to click on the button for the minecraft version of your server.
        </p>
        <h3>The Custom Item Sets folder</h3>
        <p>
            After clicking on an export button, you should go to the 'Custom Item Sets' folder on your computer.
            The exact location of that folder depends on the operating system of your computer.
            <ul>
                <li>On Windows, it should be inside your Documents folder.</li>
                <li>On Linux, it should be inside your home folder.</li>
                <li>On Macos, it should be inside Users/YourUser/Custom Item Sets</li>
            </ul>
            Modern versions of the editor will tell you where exactly that folder is located.
        </p>
        <p>
            If your item set is called 'ruby', the Custom Item Sets folder should contain the following files:
            <ul>
                <li>
                    ruby.cisb, this file is used by the editor to save and load all data about the ruby item set.
                    You normally don't need to touch this file. It's a binary file, so don't bother trying to read it.
                </li>
                <li>
                    ruby.zip, this file is the (server) resourcepack you need to use. Feel free to look what's inside it
                    if you're curious how things work. You can even edit it, but note that you will need to re-edit it
                    each time you export.
                </li>
                <li>
                    ruby.cis, this file is needed by the plug-in and needs to be put in the ServerFolder/plugins/CustomItems folder.
                    Note that the CustomItems folder will not exist until you create it manually. Also, if you run the server with
                    the plugin installed, it should create the folder automatically. This file is binary, so don't bother trying to
                    read it.
                </li>
                <li>
                    ruby.txt, this file can be used as alternative for ruby.cis and is made for hosts that do not allow
                    server owners to directly upload files to the server. If you would like to use this file, you need to put it
                    inside ServerFolder/plugins/CustomItems (just like you would if you used ruby.cis). This file is sort of binary:
                    you can open it with a text editor and copy/paste the 'text', but don't bother trying to understand it.
                </li>
            </ul>
            Additionally, there should be a 'backups' and 'logs' folder, but you can ignore those for now.
            Now that you know what the files are, it's time to use them.
        </p>
        <h3>Installing the plug-in itself</h3>
        <p>
            If you haven't done so already, you need to put the CustomItems plugin and the KnokkoCore for the right minecraft version
            in your plugins folder. You can find the available versions for CustomItems 
            <a href="https://dev.bukkit.org/projects/custom-items-and-textures/files">here</a>. You need to pick a file that starts
            with "Custom Items" and the file must be at least as new as the Editor you used to create the ruby.cis file.
        </p>
        <p>
            You can find the versions for KnokkoCore <a href="https://dev.bukkit.org/projects/knokko-core/files">here</a>.
            The names include the minecraft version it is for and the edition. For instance, "Knokko Core for minecraft 1.13 3"
            must be used for minecraft 1.13.x servers and is the third edition of KnokkoCore for minecraft 1.13.x.
            I recommend always using the latest one for your minecraft version, because <b>you will get errors if your KnokkoCore is too old</b>.
            Put both CustomItems and KnokkoCore in the plugins folder of your server.
        </p>
        <h3>Uploading your item set</h3>
        <p>
            Then create a folder called 'CustomItems' in the plugins folder of your server (if it doesn't exist already).
            In that folder, you should put either ruby.cis or ruby.txt (not both). 
            If your server host doesn't allow you to upload files, you will need to create a new file called ruby.txt in
            the 'CustomItems' folder you just created. 
            Then open the ruby.txt file in the 'Custom Item Sets' folder (on your computer), copy everything and paste
            everything into the ruby.txt in plugins/CustomItems/ruby.txt.
            If your host also doesn't allow you to create any files in your server folder, you need a better host...
        </p>
        <h3>Uploading the resourcepack</h3>
        <p>
            Unfortunately, the previous recommended server resourcepack host is no longer available. Therefore another host will have to
            be used. You can find instructions to host a server resourcepack using dropbox at 
            <a href="https://nodecraft.com/support/games/minecraft/adding-a-resource-pack-to-a-minecraft-server?utm_source=minepack.net">this webpage</a>.
            If you then visit your server, you should be asked if you would like to have the server resourcepack and you should accept it.
            If not, check <a href="troubleshooting.html">the troubleshooting page</a>.
        </p>
        <h3>Tips</h3>
        <p>
            If you quickly want to test an item set, you could instead of uploading the resourcepack as server resourcepack just put
            it in your own resourcepacks folder (AppData/Roaming/.minecraft/resourcepacks). This should have the same effect as a 
            server resourcepack <b>for you</b>, but is quicker.
