            this plug-in and all plug-ins for which this plug-in has special changes to

        <h3><a href="https://www.spigotmc.org/resources/actionbarapi-1-8-1-14-2.1315/">Action Bar API</a></h3>
        <p>
            This plug-in provides an action bar API that my plug-in will use if 
            it is available. If you install it alongside my plug-in, the wand 
            cooldown/charges and custom tool durability will be shown in the 
            action bars of players.
        </p>
        <b>
            Note: This plug-in officially only supports minecraft 1.14.x and earlier,
            but it seems to work on minecraft 1.15.x as well. If you have a spigot 
            server of minecraft 1.16.x or later, you can use
            <a href="https://github.com/Bobcat00/ActionBarAPI/releases">this unofficial patch</a>
             instead.

        <h3><a href="https://dev.bukkit.org/projects/mythicmobs">Mythic Mobs</a></h3>
        <p>
            It is possible to equip custom items from this plug-in on mobs from
            Mythic Mobs. To do so, you need to configure a mythic mobs item in 
            a configuration file for mythic mobs (for instance <b>ExampleItems.yml</b>).
            In such a file, you should define a custom item like this:
        </p>
        <textarea readonly cols="50" rows="4">
MythicMobsItemName:
  NBT:
    KnokkosCustomItems: { Name: item_name }
        </textarea>
        <p>
            In the example above, <i>item_name</i> should be the <b>Name</b> that
            you gave the custom item in the Editor. <b>Not</b> the <b>Display name</b>. 
            Then, you should configure a custom mob to equip this item in a mob file 
            (for instance <b>ExampleMobs.yml</b>):
        </p>
        <textarea readonly cols="50" rows="5">
MobName:
  Type: ZOMBIE
  Equipment:
  - MythicMobsItemName HAND
        </textarea>
        <h3><a href="https://www.spigotmc.org/resources/crazy-enchantments.16470/">Crazy Enchantments</a></h3>
        <p>
            The enchantments from the Crazy Enchantments plug-in can be used as the
            <a href="../editor documentation/edit menu/items/edit/enchantments.html">default enchantments</a>
            of custom items. The crazy enchantments will be listed after the vanilla enchantments and have a
            "[CRAZY]" suffix after their name. Furthermore, this plug-in has nice support for the Hellforge 
            enchantment on custom items. If a custom item would be repaired with the HellForged enchantment, its 
            custom durability will be repaired instead of the vanilla durability.
            If crazy enchantments is not installed, nothing will happen, except a 
            message in the console stating that crazy enchantments doesn't seem to be installed.
        </p>

            Custom items and custom blocks can be used in Skripts.

        <p>
            This plug-in has small changes that allow users to use custom items from this plug-in in 
            its configuration files. For information of how to use this, take a look at
            <a href="https://commoncore.jakubvanko.com/docs/03_configuration#custom-item-and-textures-experimental">commoncore config info</a>
            at the section 'Custom Item and Textures (experimental)'.

        <h3><a href="https://www.spigotmc.org/resources/mimic.82515/">Mimic</a></h3>
        <p>
            Mimic is a plug-in that makes it easier to integrate custom item plug-ins with plug-ins that would like to use 
            custom items (and some other integrations that are irrelevant for this plug-in). Custom items from this plug-in 
            can be used by plug-ins that use Mimic. The identifiers of items from this plug-in will be like <b>knokkoscustomitems:item_name</b>
            where <b>item_name</b> is the name you used in the Editor.
        </p>
        <h3><a href="https://polymart.org/resource/item-bridge.4">ItemBridge</a></h3>
        <p>
            Just like Mimic, ItemBridge is a plug-in that makes it easier to integrate custom item plug-ins with plug-ins that would 
            like to use custom items. (This plug-in integrates with both Mimic and ItemBridge for optimal reach.) The identifiers of 
            items from this plug-in will be like <b>KnokkosCustomItems:item_name</b> where <b>item_name</b> is the name you used in 
            the Editor.
