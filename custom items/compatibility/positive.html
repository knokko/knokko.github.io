            This page lists all plug-ins that have special changes to improve support for 
            this plug-in and all plug-ins for which this plug-in has special changes to
            improve support. (At least, all plug-ins that I'm aware off and I didn't forget).

        <h3><a href="https://www.spigotmc.org/resources/actionbarapi-1-8-1-19.86006/">Action Bar API</a></h3>
        <p>
            This plug-in provides an action bar API that my plug-in will use if 
            it is available. If you install it alongside my plug-in, the wand 
            cooldown/charges and custom tool durability will be shown in the 
            action bars of players.

        <h3><a href="https://dev.bukkit.org/projects/mythicmobs">Mythic Mobs</a></h3>
        <p>
            It is possible to equip custom items from this plug-in on mobs from
            Mythic Mobs. To do so, you need to configure a mythic mobs item in 
            a configuration file for mythic mobs (for instance <b>ExampleItems.yml</b>).
            In such a file, you should define a custom item like this:
        </p>
        <textarea readonly cols="50" rows="4">
MythicMobsItemName:
  NBT:
    KnokkosCustomItems: { Name: item_name }
        </textarea>
        <p>
            In the example above, <i>item_name</i> should be the <b>Name</b> that
            you gave the custom item in the Editor. <b>Not</b> the <b>Display name</b>. 
            Then, you should configure a custom mob to equip this item in a mob file 
            (for instance <b>ExampleMobs.yml</b>):
        </p>
        <textarea readonly cols="50" rows="5">
MobName:
  Type: ZOMBIE
  Equipment:
  - MythicMobsItemName HAND
        </textarea>
        <h3><a href="https://www.spigotmc.org/resources/crazy-enchantments.16470/">Crazy Enchantments</a></h3>
        <p>
            The enchantments from the Crazy Enchantments plug-in can be used as the
            <a href="../editor documentation/edit menu/items/edit/enchantments.html">default enchantments</a>
            of custom items. The crazy enchantments will be listed after the vanilla enchantments and have a
            "[CRAZY]" suffix after their name. Furthermore, this plug-in has nice support for the Hellforge 
            enchantment on custom items. If a custom item would be repaired with the HellForged enchantment, its 
            custom durability will be repaired instead of the vanilla durability.
            If crazy enchantments is not installed, nothing will happen, except a 
            message in the console stating that crazy enchantments doesn't seem to be installed.
        </p>

        Custom items and custom blocks can be used in Denizen scripts. Unfortunately, the Denizen VS Code extensions
        doesn't recognize them, so you will get some warnings and errors, which you should ignore.

        <p>
            This plug-in has small changes that allow users to use custom items from this plug-in in 
            its configuration files. For information of how to use this, take a look at
            <a href="https://commoncore.jakubvanko.com/docs/03_configuration#custom-item-and-textures-experimental">commoncore config info</a>
            at the section 'Custom Item and Textures (experimental)'.

        <h3><a href="https://www.spigotmc.org/resources/mimic.82515/">Mimic</a></h3>
        <p>
            Mimic is a plug-in that makes it easier to integrate custom item plug-ins with plug-ins that would like to use 
            custom items (and some other integrations that are irrelevant for this plug-in). Custom items from this plug-in 
            can be used by plug-ins that use Mimic. The identifiers of items from this plug-in will be like <b>knokkoscustomitems:item_name</b>
            where <b>item_name</b> is the name you used in the Editor.
        </p>
        <h3><a href="https://polymart.org/resource/item-bridge.4">ItemBridge</a></h3>
        <p>
            Just like Mimic, ItemBridge is a plug-in that makes it easier to integrate custom item plug-ins with plug-ins that would 
            like to use custom items. (This plug-in integrates with both Mimic and ItemBridge for optimal reach.) The identifiers of 
            items from this plug-in will be like <b>KnokkosCustomItems:item_name</b> where <b>item_name</b> is the name you used in 
            the Editor.
        </p>
        <h3><a href="https://www.spigotmc.org/resources/magic.1056/">Magic</a></h3>
        <p>
            The Magic plug-in adds mana and spells. If you use Magic alongside this plug-in, wands from this plug-in can
            consume mana from Magic and/or launch Magic spells rather than custom projectiles. If you also install
            ActionBarAPI, players can see their current mana while holding a custom wand that requires mana.
        </p>
        <p>
            Note: Magic overrides the server resourcepack by default, which will hide the custom textures from
            this plug-in. You can turn this behavior off by putting <i>default_resource_pack: ""</i> in their
            <i>config.yml</i>.

        <p>
            The SilkSpawners plug-in allows players with the right permissions to mine mob spawners blocks when they
            are using the right pickaxe with the silk touch enchantment. In their config, you can configure the allowed
            pickaxes like this:
        </p>
        <textarea readonly cols="100" rows="4">
# Allowed set of tools which can mine a spawner. IDs are supported, too
allowedTools:
- STONE_PICKAXE
- knokkoscustomitems:silk_pickaxe
        </textarea>
        <p>
            This would allow players to either mine mob spawners with a stone pickaxe, or with a custom pickaxe
            from this plug-in called <b>silk_pickaxe</b> (when it has the silk touch enchantment). Note:
        </p>
        <ul>
            <li>
                Players with the <b>silkspawners.nosilk.*</b> permission can mine mob spawners with any pickaxe, 
                with or without silk touch. <b>When you are OP, you have this permission.</b> So, when you want to
                test this feature, make sure to deop yourself first.
            </li>
            <li>
                Players without the <b>silkspawners.silkdrop.*</b> permission can't mine any mob spawners at all,
                regardless of whether they have the right pickaxe and silk touch. So, when you want to test this
                feature, make sure that you give yourself this permission.
