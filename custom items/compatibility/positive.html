            This page lists all plug-ins that have special changes to improve support for 
            this plug-in and all plug-ins for which this plug-in has special changes to
            improve support. (At least, all plug-ins that I'm aware off and I didn't forget).

        <h3><a href="https://www.spigotmc.org/resources/actionbarapi-1-8-1-14-2.1315/">Action Bar API</a></h3>
        <p>
            This plug-in provides an action bar API that my plug-in will use if 
            it is available. If you install it alongside my plug-in, the wand 
            cooldown/charges and custom tool durability will be shown in the 
            action bars of players.
        </p>
        <b>
            Note: This plug-in officially only supports minecraft 1.14.x and earlier,
            but it seems to work on minecraft 1.15.x as well. If you have a spigot 
            server of minecraft 1.16.x or later, you can use
            <a href="https://github.com/Bobcat00/ActionBarAPI/releases">this unofficial patch</a>
             instead.

        <h3><a href="https://www.spigotmc.org/resources/crazy-enchantments.16470/">Crazy Enchantments</a></h3>
        <p>
            This plug-in has nice support for the Hellforge enchantment on custom items.
            If a custom item would be repaired with the HellForged enchantment, its 
            custom durability will be repaired instead of the vanilla durability.
            If crazy enchantments is not installed, nothing will happen, except a 
            message in the console stating that crazy enchantments doesn't seem to be installed.

        <p>
            This plug-in has small changes that allow users to use custom items from this plug-in in 
            its configuration files. For information of how to use this, take a look at
