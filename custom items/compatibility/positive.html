            This page lists all plug-ins that have special changes to improve support for 
            this plug-in and all plug-ins for which this plug-in has special changes to
            improve support. (At least, all plug-ins that I'm aware off and I didn't forget).

        <h3><a href="https://www.spigotmc.org/resources/crazy-enchantments.16470/">Crazy Enchantments</a></h3>
        <p>
            This plug-in has nice support for the Hellforge enchantment on custom items.
            If a custom item would be repaired with the HellForged enchantment, its 
            custom durability will be repaired instead of the vanilla durability.
            If crazy enchantments is not installed, nothing will happen, except a 
            message in the console stating that crazy enchantments doesn't seem to be installed.
