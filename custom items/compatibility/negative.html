            This page lists plug-ins that do not work very well alongside this plug-in or do
            not interact well. This list is far from complete because I can't test my plug-in 
            with every single other plug-in.
        </p>
        <h3><a href="https://www.spigotmc.org/resources/itemfixer-remove-creative-hacked-items-from-your-server.34250/">Item Fixer</a></h3>
        <p>
            The ItemFixer plug-in removes all kinds of 'cheated' properties of items like nbt tags
            and impossible enchantments. Since all custom items have such 'cheated' properties,
            this will cause all custom items to remove their texture and special properties as 
            soon as any non-op player holds it in their hand.
        </p>
        <h3><a href="https://www.spigotmc.org/resources/2ls-exploitfixer-the-ultimate-antiexploit-plugin.62842/">Exploit Fixer</a></h3>
        <p>
            The ExploitFixer plug-in prevents all kinds of exploits, including hacked 
            creative items. Unfortunately, it considers all custom items to be hacked 
            creative items, and removes all their special powers and their texture.
        </p>
        <p>
            Luckily, this only happens in creative mode, so this won't be a problem if 
            players don't need to be in creative mode.
            To prevent this anyway, you can disable <b>itemsfix</b> in the config. The
            drawback of this is that players in creative mode can obtain any item they 
            want. (But note that players can give themselves stacks of diamond blocks
            anyway, so you should be careful with giving players creative mode even
            if you keep <b>itemsfix</b> enabled).
        </p>
        <h3><a href="https://docs.songoda.com/ultimate-series/ultimatestacker">Ultimate Stacker</a></h3>
        <p>
            The UltimateStacker plug-in will quickly fill up your inventory when you 
            pick up a stack of custom items. You can work around this problem by disabling
            item stacking in its config.
        </p>
        <h3>Custom crafting recipe plug-ins</h3>
        <p>
            To prevent custom items from being used in vanilla crafting recipes, this plug-in will 
            block any attempt to use custom items as crafting ingredients that is not registered
            as custom crafting recipe in the editor.
            Unfortunately, this also prevents other crafting recipe plug-ins from using custom items 
            in their recipes. All crafting recipes with normal ingredients should still work though.
        </p>
        <h3>Other custom item plug-ins</h3>
        <p>
            Using other custom item plug-ins alongside this plug-in is probably going to cause trouble,
            especially if they also have custom textures. If that other plug-in uses the same 
            mechanism for custom textures as this one, weird effects can occur.
        </p>
        <h3>Worldguard</h3>
        <p>
            Custom containers that are inside protected WorldGuard regions will not 
            be protected (unless you make sure players can't get close to the custom 
            container).
