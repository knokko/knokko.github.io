        <h1>Wands and Guns tutorial</h1>
        <p>
            In this tutorial, I will demonstrate how to add (custom) wands and guns with this plug-in. They are described in this 
            same tutorial because wands and guns are surprisingly similar: they both fire <b>custom projectiles</b>. The difference 
            is that wands don't need bullets (they can only have a cooldown and charges). Guns can have have cooldowns, can require
            bullets directly from the inventory, or they need to be loaded before they can shoot. The exact system will be configured 
            by you.
        </p>
        <p><b>
            This is an advanced tutorial, so I will not show the basic setup needed for this plug-in. I recommend reading or watching
            one of the basic tutorials first (if you haven't done so already).
            This tutorial was created with Editor 9.6. If you are using an older version of the Editor, you might miss some of the 
            features I show here. In that case, you should download a newer version of the Editor.
        </b></p>
        <h2>Custom projectiles</h2>
        <p>
            Before you can create wands and guns, you need to define the projectiles they will fire. These 3 images will guide you 
            to get started (if you have used the Editor before, you should immediately recognize the menu in the left-most screenshot):
        </p>
        <img src="projectiles1.png" width="20%"/> <img src="projectiles2.png" width="20%" /> <img src="projectiles3.png" width="20%" />
        <p>
            After clicking on each of the buttons in the red circles, you should see this:
        </p>
        <img src="../../editor documentation/edit menu/projectiles/edit.png" width="40%" />
        <p>
            There are many properties of the projectile that you can configure here, but only the <b>Name</b> is required. All custom 
            projectiles must have a distinct name, but other than that, the name matters very little. Click the question mark on the 
            top-left of the page for information about the other properties:
        </p>
        <img src="questionMark.png" width="40%" />
        <h3>Visibility</h3>
        <p>
            <b>By default, custom projectiles are invisible.</b> There are 2 ways to make them visible:
            <ul>
                <li>Give the projectile a <b>projectile cover</b>.</li>
                <li>Use <b>in-flight effects</b> that frequently spawn particles or firework at the location of the projectile.</li>
            </ul>
            For the first projectile in this tutorial, I will go with the second approach. The first approach will be demonstrated
            later in this tutorial.
        </p>
        <h3>In-flight effects</h3>
        <p>
            In-flight effects are 'effects' that will be 'played' periodically at the location of the custom projectile. To get 
            started, follow these steps:
        </p>
        <img src="flightEffects1.png" width="20%" /> <img src="flightEffects2.png" width="20%" />
        <p>
            If you followed these steps, you should see this:
        </p>
        <img src="../../editor documentation/edit menu/projectiles/effects/waves/edit.png" width="40%" />
        <p>
            Every custom projectile has an (initially empty) list of projectile effect <b>waves</b> and each <b>wave</b> has a list of 
            projectile effects and some timing properties. All projectile effects <b>in the same wave</b> will always be executed at the
            same time. Projectile effects from different ways can be executed independently. This page allows you to configure a 
            <b>single wave</b>. The <b>Ticks until first round</b> is the number of ticks (1 tick = 0.05 seconds) between the time the 
            custom projectile is launched and the <b>first time</b> the effects in the wave are executed. The <b>Ticks between rounds</b>
            is the delay in ticks between consecutive executions of the effects. For instance, if <i>Ticks until first round is 20</i>
            and <i>Ticks between rounds</i> is 40, the effects in the wave will be executed at the following moments:
            <ol>
                <li>1 second (20 ticks) after the projectile was launched</li>
                <li>3 seconds (20 + 40 = 60 ticks) after the projectile was launched</li>
                <li>5 seconds (20 + 2 * 40 = 100 ticks) after the projectile was launched</li>
                <li>7 seconds</li>
                <li>9 seconds</li>
                <li>... (this goes on until the projectile hits something or it despawns)</li>
            </ol>
            For decorative/display projectile effects, it is good to use very small values for <i>Ticks until first round</i> and
            <i>Ticks between rounds</i>. I will give both of them the value 1. Click on the <i>Change...</i> button on the right of 
            <b>Effects each round</b> to configure the effects that will be executed. You should see this:
        </p>
        <img src="flightEffects3.png" width="40%" />
        <p>
            This page is mostly empty because you haven't added any effects yet. To add an effect, click on the green <b>Add</b>
            button. After doing that, you should see this:
        </p>
        <img src="../../editor documentation/edit menu/projectiles/effects/create.png" width="40%" />
        <p>
            These are all the kinds of projectile effects you can add. The following projectile effects can be used to make the 
            projectile visible:
            <ul>
                <li>Show fireworks</li>
                <li>Spawn colored redstone dust</li>
                <li>Spawn simple particle</li>
                <li>Create explosion (but this one has dangerous side effects like destroying blocks)</li>
            </ul>
            In this tutorial, I will go for <i>Spawn colored redstone dust</i>. Clicking its button should take you to the following 
            menu:
        </p>
        <img src="../../editor documentation/edit menu/projectiles/effects/edit/colored.png" width="40%" />
        <p>
            You can configure the color of the redstone dust particles (you can choose any color; so doesn't have to be red). You 
            can use a site like <a href="https://www.colorspire.com/rgb-color-wheel/">RGB color wheel</a> to see which color will 
            be shown for given <b>R</b>ed, <b>G</b>reen, and <b>B</b>lue values. If your minimum and maximum red/green/blue are 
            not the same, there will be some random variation in the color of the particles that will be spawned. You can also control
            how many particles (<b>amount</b>) will be spawned per effect execution and how far they can be away from the projectile 
            (<b>radius</b>). I will stick with the default values this time. Click on <b>Create</b> when you are done with 
            configuring. You should be taken back to this menu:
        </p>
        <img src="flightEffects4.png" width="40%" />
        <p>
            If you want, you can click on <b>Add</b> to add another effect. When you are happy with your effects, you should click on
            <b>Back</b> and then on <b>Create</b>. After doing that, you should see (something like) this:
        </p>
        <img src="flightEffects5.png" width="40%" />
        <p>
            If you want, you can click on <b>Add effects</b> to add another <b>wave of effects</b>. If not, you should click on
            <b>Back</b>. You should be taken back to this menu:
        </p>
        <img src="../../editor documentation/edit menu/projectiles/edit.png" width="40%" />
        <h3>Impact effects</h3>
        <p>
            Custom projectiles can also have <b>impact effects</b>. Unlike <b>in flight</b> effects, the <b>impact</b> effects is 
            just a single list of projectile effects. All impact effects will be executed once when the projectile hits something or
            someone. If the projectile despawns, the impact effects will <b>not</b> be executed. For this tutorial projectile, I will 
            add a fireworks impact effect. To do so, click on <b>Impact effects</b> and then on <b>Add</b> and finally on
            <b>Show fireworks</b>. You should have been taken to this menu:
        </p>
        <img src="../../editor documentation/edit menu/projectiles/effects/edit/firework.png" width="40%" />
        <p>
            Firework projectile effects are the most complicated effects to configure (because minecraf fireworks are generally
            quite advanced). But, for a simple firework effect, there is only 1 thing you need to do: add a color:
        </p>
        <img src="fireworks.png" width="40%" />
        <p>
            The default color is pink, but you can change it to any color you want. You can again use 
            <a href="https://www.colorspire.com/rgb-color-wheel/">RGB color wheel</a> (or a similar site) to choose a color.
            You can configure more if you want, but it is not needed. Click the question mark on the top-left for information 
            about the rest of the properties you can configure. When you are done with this effect, click <b>Create</b>.
            If you want to add more impact effects, click on <b>Add</b>. If not, click on <b>Back</b>. You should be taken back 
            to this menu again:
        </p>
        <img src="../../editor documentation/edit menu/projectiles/edit.png" width="40%" />
        <p>
            Click on <b>Create</b> to finish the custom projectile. That should take you to this page:
        </p>
        <img src="projectiles4.png" width="40%" />
        <p>
            I gave my projectile the name <i>particle_projectile</i>. If you choose another name, that name should be shown 
            instead. The first projectile is finished, but it needs a wand or gun to launch it. I will first show how to create a 
            wand that will fire the projectile. Guns will be demonstrated later.
        </p>
        <h2>Wands</h2>
        <p>
            To create a wand, follow these steps:
        </p>
        <img src="projectiles5.png" width="18%" /> <img src="projectiles6.png" width="18%" /> <img src="wands1.png" width="18%" /> 
        <img src="wands2.png" width="18%" /> <img src="wands3.png" width="18%" />
        <p>
            You should have been taken to this page:
        </p>
        <img src="../../editor documentation/edit menu/items/edit/wand.png" width="40%" />
        <p>
            Like most other items, you need to give the wand a <b>Name</b> and <b>Texture</b>. I will use the following texture:
        </p>
        <img src="fire_wand.png" />
        <p>
            You must also give the wand a <b>Projectile</b>. You should choose the projectile you just created. You can also configure 
            the <b>Max charges</b>, <b>Recharge time</b> (this will appear when you increase <b>Max charges</b>), <b>Amount per shot</b>,
            and <b>Cooldown</b>. Click the question mark on the top-left for more information about them. I will just go with the 
            default values. To finish the wand, click <b>Create</b>. Once you have done that, you are ready to test your first 
            projectile and wand: Export your item set, replace your .cis file and resourcepack, and start your server!
        </p>
        <p>
            To try your new wand, you can acquire it using <b>/kci give wand_name</b> and fire it by right-clicking. It should leave
            a redstone trail wherever it goes and show fireworks whenever it hits something:
