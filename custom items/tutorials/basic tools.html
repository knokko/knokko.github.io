    <h1>Basic item and tools</h1>
    <p>This tutorial will show you how to create a ruby item as well as a ruby sword and pickaxe that can be
        crafted using that ruby. It will also demonstrate how to use the item set on a server.</p>
    <h2>The editor</h2>
    <p>If you haven't done this already, you should start by downloading the editor from BukkitDev.
        Download the latest Editor from the <a target="_blank"
            href="https://dev.bukkit.org/projects/custom-items-and-textures/files">Files section</a>.
        It doesn't really matter where you put the editor you downloaded, but you should be able to find it later. </p>
    <p>The editor is a java application, which means that you need to have Java installed on your computer in order to
        use it.
        If you are using Windows, Java was very likely installed by default, so you can use the editor right away. If
        you are using a Mac,
        you probably have it as well, but I never tried that. If you are on Linux, it was probably not installed by
        default, but you should
        know what you are doing if you choose to use Linux.</p>
    <p>Now you should open your file explorer and navigate to wherever you put the editor when you downloaded it.
        Then double click on it to start it.
        If everything is alright, you should see the following window (or something similar if you are using another
        version of the editor): </p>
    <img width="400px" src="main menu.png" />
    <p>Yeah yeah, it isn't pretty, but the alternative would be writing long configuration files and resourcepacks with
        many item models
        and resourcepack predicates with some text editor.</p>
    <h2>Creating the item set</h2>
    <h3>Starting</h3>
    <p>To use this plug-in, you will need to create your own item set in the editor.
        It will contain all items, textures, models, recipes and everything else related to the plug-in.
        You can only use 1 item set at a time in your minecraft server, so you should usually have just 1 item set.
    </p>
    <p>To get started, click on the 'New item set'.
        You should see a simple (and ugly) menu where you need to select the name of your item set.
        If you just have 1 item set, the name doesn't really matter.
        The name will be used to determine some file names for files that will be created later, so don't use special
        characters in the name.
        To type the name, click on the edit field at the right of the 'Filename:'.
        It should turn white when you click on it, which means it is waiting for you to type something.
        Once you have typed the name, click on the 'Create' button.
        If everything went well, you should see something like this:
    </p>
    <img width="400px" src="edit menu.png" />
    <h3>The textures</h3>
    <p>The whole point of this plug-in is that you can add custom items with their own textures without the need for any
        mods
        or overwriting textures of other items.</p>
    <h4>Creating the textures</h4>
    <p>You will be the one that needs to create their textures. The editor is not an image editor, so you will need some
        other
        program to create your images.
        I would recommend to use <a href="https://www.getpaint.net/">paint.NET</a> for this (it's an application, not a
        website).
        However, you are free to pick whatever program you want. Use your image editor to create images of 16 by 16
        pixels, 32 by 32,
        64 by 64, 128 by 128, 256 by 256 or 512 by 512 images. You should save them on your computer and remember where
        you stored them.
        Please note that all images you create will be put in a resourcepack and players will have to download that
        resourcepack the
        first time they join the server and whenever you update the item set on the server, so using many big images
        will cause them
        to wait for a while because they would have to download a big resourcepack. Also, the editor will take more time
        to save and load
        if there are many big images.
        The textures I will be using are:
    </p><img src="ruby.png" /><img src="ruby_pickaxe.png" /><img src="ruby_sword.png" />
    <h4>Loading the textures</h4>
    <p>Now that you made your textures and saved them as images on your computer, go back to the editor and click on the
        'Textures' button.
        This should bring you to the texture overview page, which is almost empty because you haven't loaded any
        textures yet.
        Click on the 'Load texture' button to load your first texture into the item set.
        Click on 'Load simple texture' because we won't be making bows this tutorial.
        Clicking on the 'Edit...' button will bring you to the (ugly) file selection menu.
        It will start in the folder where the editor is located and it will show all folders and .png files in the
        current folder.
        If there are many files, you can scroll with the mouse wheel or the arrow keys.
        The 'Go up' button will show you the parent directory (the folder where the current folder is in).
        Navigate to wherever you stored your textures and click on one of them to select it.
        Then click on the 'Select' button to confirm the selection.
        When you confirm the selection, the editor will copy the selected image into the item set.
        If you modify the image thereafter,
        the texture in the item set will stay the same and you will have to explicitely edit it in the editor.
        The texture you selected should appear on the left of the 'Edit...' button.
        In my case, it looks like this:
    </p>
    <img width="400px" src="ruby texture loading.png" />
    <p>Now type the name of the texture in the edit field on the right of the 'Name:' label.
        The name is not allowed to have special characters, only the alphabet and the underscore _ are currently
        allowed.
        But don't worry, your players won't see the name of the texture in-game anyway.
        All they can see in-game is the display names of the custom items using that texture.
        The names of the textures are not secret either though, players can retrieve them if they know what they are
        doing.
        Once you typed the name, click on the 'Create' button.
    </p>
    <p>After clicking 'Create', you should go back to the texture overview, but this time you should see the texture you
        uploaded in the overview.
        Now you should load the textures for the sword and pickaxe as well.
        I won't demonstrate this again, because the process is exactly the same.
        After you loaded all 3 textures, click on the 'Back' button in the texture overview.
    </p>
    <h2>The items</h2>
    <p>Now that you have loaded the textures, it is time to make the custom items.
        Click on the 'Items' button, this will bring you to the (currently empty) item overview.
        To create your first item, click on the 'Create item' button.
        Now you can choose what kind of item you would like to create.
        By the time of writing this, there are 13 kinds of items to choose from, and this will likely become more in the
        future.
    </p>
    <h3>The simple ruby item</h3>
        Let's start with the ruby itself, which will be a 'Simple Item', so click on the 'Simple Item' button.
        You should then see the following menu:
    </p>
    <img width="400px" src="item edit menu.png" />
    <p>As you can see, you can choose a 'Name' and a 'Display name'. The display name is the name players will see in-game.
        You can use uppercase characters and whitespaces within the display name to get it how you want it.
        You can also use the & character to use color codes in the display name if you like.
        The 'Name' of the item is like the name of textures, normal players won't see it in-game and you can't use special
        characters in it.
        However, server operators can see the names of all custom items using the '/customitems list' command and will need
        those names for the '/customitems give [custom item name]' command.
        For the 'Name', I will simply use 'ruby' and I will use 'Ruby' for the 'Display name'.
        Besides the name and display name, you will also need to select the Texture of the item.
        To select the texture, click on the 'None' button on the right of the 'Texture:' label.
        Then click on the 'ruby' label on the right of the ruby texture to choose it.
        As you can see, there are many other things like Attribute Modifiers and Item Flags.
        For the simply ruby item, we will ignore these, but we will explain some of them when creating the sword and pickaxe.
        Now click on the 'Create' button to add the ruby item to the item set.
    </p>
    <h3>The ruby sword</h3>
    <p>Now that you have added the ruby item, it's time to add the ruby sword. 
        To start creating the sword, click on 'Create item' and then on 'Sword'.
    </p>
