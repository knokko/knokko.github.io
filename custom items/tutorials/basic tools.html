        <h1>Basic item and tools</h1>
        <p>This tutorial will show you how to create a simple custom item as well as a sword and a pickaxe that can be 
            crafted using that simple custom item. It will also demonstrate how to use the item set on a server.</p>
        <h2>The editor</h2>
        <p>If you haven't done this already, you should start by downloading the editor from BukkitDev. 
            Download the latest Editor from the <a target="_blank" href="https://dev.bukkit.org/projects/custom-items-and-textures/files">Files section</a>.
            It doesn't really matter where you put the editor you downloaded, but you should be able to find it later. </p>
        <p>The editor is a java application, which means that you need to have Java installed on your computer in order to use it. 
            If you are using Windows, Java was very likely installed by default, so you can use the editor right away. If you are using a Mac,
            you probably have it as well, but I never tried that. If you are on Linux, it was probably not installed by default, but you should
            know what you are doing if you choose to use Linux.</p>
        <p>Now you should open your file explorer and navigate to wherever you put the editor when you downloaded it.
            Then double click on it to start it. 
            If everything is alright, you should see the following window (or something similar if you are using another version of the editor): </p>
            <img width="400px" src="main menu.png" />
            <p>Yeah yeah, it isn't pretty, but the alternative would be writing long configuration files and resourcepacks with many item models
            and resourcepack predicates with some text editor.</p>
        <h2>Creating the item set</h2>
        <h3>Starting</h3>
        <p>To use this plug-in, you will need to create your own item set in the editor. 
            It will contain all items, textures, models, recipes and everything else related to the plug-in.
            You can only use 1 item set at a time in your minecraft server, so you should usually have just 1 item set.
        </p>
        <p>To get started, click on the 'New item set'.
            You should see a simple (and ugly) menu where you need to select the name of your item set.
            If you just have 1 item set, the name doesn't really matter.
            The name will be used to determine some file names for files that will be created later, so don't use special characters in the name.
            To type the name, click on the edit field at the right of the 'Filename:'.
            It should turn white when you click on it, which means it is waiting for you to type something.
            Once you have typed the name, click on the 'Create' button.
            If everything went well, you should see something like this:
        </p>
        <img width="400px" src="edit menu.png" />
        <h3>The textures</h3>
        <p>The whole point of this plug-in is that you can add custom items with their own textures without the need for any mods
            or overwriting textures of other items.</p>
        <h4>Creating the textures</h4>
        <p>You will be the one that needs to create their textures. The editor is not an image editor, so you will need some other
            program to create your images. 
            I would recommend to use <a href="https://www.getpaint.net/">paint.NET</a> for this (it's an application, not a website).
            However, you are free to pick whatever program you want. Use your image editor to create images of 16 by 16 pixels, 32 by 32,
            64 by 64, 128 by 128, 256 by 256 or 512 by 512 images. You should save them on your computer and remember where you stored them.
            Please note that all images you create will be put in a resourcepack and players will have to download that resourcepack the 
            first time they join the server and whenever you update the item set on the server, so using many big images will cause them
            to wait for a while because they would have to download a big resourcepack. Also, the editor will take more time to save and load
            if there are many big images.
