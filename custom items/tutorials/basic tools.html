    <h1>Basic item and tools</h1>
    <p>This tutorial will show you how to create a ruby item as well as a ruby sword and pickaxe that can be
        crafted using that ruby. It will also demonstrate how to use the item set on a server.
        This tutorial will not show you everything you can do with this plug-in (that would become a long tutorial).
        I may or may not make more tutorials, depending on the number of requests I get to do so and on how much time I have.
        This tutorial will assume you already have a (1.12 or later) minecraft server and that you have access to its files.
    </p>
    <h2>The editor</h2>
    <p>If you haven't done this already, you should start by downloading the editor from BukkitDev.
        Download the latest Editor from the <a target="_blank"
            href="https://dev.bukkit.org/projects/custom-items-and-textures/files">Files section</a>.
        For this tutorial, I will be using Editor 5.6.
        It doesn't really matter where you put the editor you downloaded, but you should be able to find it later. </p>
    <p>The editor is a java application, which means that you need to have Java installed on your computer in order to
        use it.
        If you are using Windows, Java was very likely installed by default, so you can use the editor right away. If
        you are using a Mac,
        you probably have it as well, but I never tried that. If you are on Linux, it was probably not installed by
        default, but you should
        know what you are doing if you choose to use Linux.</p>
    <p>Now you should open your file explorer and navigate to wherever you put the editor when you downloaded it.
        Then double click on it to start it.
        If everything is alright, you should see the following window (or something similar if you are using another
        version of the editor): </p>
    <img width="400px" src="main menu.png" />
    <p>Yeah yeah, it isn't pretty, but the alternative would be writing long configuration files and resourcepacks with
        many item models
        and resourcepack predicates with some text editor.</p>
    <h2>Creating the item set</h2>
    <h3>Starting</h3>
    <p>To use this plug-in, you will need to create your own item set in the editor.
        It will contain all items, textures, models, recipes and everything else related to the plug-in.
        You can only use 1 item set at a time in your minecraft server, so you should usually have just 1 item set.
    </p>
    <p>To get started, click on the 'New item set'.
        You should see a simple (and ugly) menu where you need to select the name of your item set.
        If you just have 1 item set, the name doesn't really matter.
        The name will be used to determine some file names for files that will be created later, so don't use special
        characters in the name.
        To type the name, click on the edit field at the right of the 'Filename:'.
        It should turn white when you click on it, which means it is waiting for you to type something.
        Once you have typed the name, click on the 'Create' button.
        If everything went well, you should see something like this:
    </p>
    <img width="400px" src="edit menu.png" />
    <h3>The textures</h3>
    <p>The whole point of this plug-in is that you can add custom items with their own textures without the need for any
        mods
        or overwriting textures of other items.</p>
    <h4>Creating the textures</h4>
    <p>You will be the one that needs to create their textures. The editor is not an image editor, so you will need some
        other
        program to create your images.
        I would recommend to use <a href="https://www.getpaint.net/">paint.NET</a> for this (it's an application, not a
        website).
        However, you are free to pick whatever program you want. Use your image editor to create images of 16 by 16
        pixels, 32 by 32,
        64 by 64, 128 by 128, 256 by 256 or 512 by 512 images. You should save them on your computer and remember where
        you stored them.
        Please note that all images you create will be put in a resourcepack and players will have to download that
        resourcepack the
        first time they join the server and whenever you update the item set on the server, so using many big images
        will cause them
        to wait for a while because they would have to download a big resourcepack. Also, the editor will take more time
        to save and load
        if there are many big images.
        The textures I will be using are:
    </p><img src="ruby.png" /><img src="ruby_pickaxe.png" /><img src="ruby_sword.png" />
    <h4>Loading the textures</h4>
    <p>Now that you made your textures and saved them as images on your computer, go back to the editor and click on the
        'Textures' button.
        This should bring you to the texture overview page, which is almost empty because you haven't loaded any
        textures yet.
        Click on the 'Load texture' button to load your first texture into the item set.
        Click on 'Load simple texture' because we won't be making bows this tutorial.
        Clicking on the 'Edit...' button will bring you to the (ugly) file selection menu.
        It will start in the folder where the editor is located and it will show all folders and .png files in the
        current folder.
        If there are many files, you can scroll with the mouse wheel or the arrow keys.
        The 'Go up' button will show you the parent directory (the folder where the current folder is in).
        Navigate to wherever you stored your textures and click on one of them to select it.
        Then click on the 'Select' button to confirm the selection.
        When you confirm the selection, the editor will copy the selected image into the item set.
        If you modify the image thereafter,
        the texture in the item set will stay the same and you will have to explicitely edit it in the editor.
        The texture you selected should appear on the left of the 'Edit...' button.
        In my case, it looks like this:
    </p>
    <img width="400px" src="ruby texture loading.png" />
    <p>Now type the name of the texture in the edit field on the right of the 'Name:' label.
        The name is not allowed to have special characters, only the alphabet and the underscore _ are currently
        allowed.
        But don't worry, your players won't see the name of the texture in-game anyway.
        All they can see in-game is the display names of the custom items using that texture.
        The names of the textures are not secret either though, players can retrieve them if they know what they are
        doing.
        Once you typed the name, click on the 'Create' button.
    </p>
    <p>After clicking 'Create', you should go back to the texture overview, but this time you should see the texture you
        uploaded in the overview.
        Now you should load the textures for the sword and pickaxe as well.
        I won't demonstrate this again, because the process is exactly the same.
        After you loaded all 3 textures, click on the 'Back' button in the texture overview.
    </p>
    <h2>The items</h2>
    <p>Now that you have loaded the textures, it is time to make the custom items.
        Click on the 'Items' button, this will bring you to the (currently empty) item overview.
        To create your first item, click on the 'Create item' button.
        Now you can choose what kind of item you would like to create.
        By the time of writing this, there are 13 kinds of items to choose from, and this will likely become more in the
        future.
    </p>
    <h3>The simple ruby item</h3>
    Let's start with the ruby itself, which will be a 'Simple Item', so click on the 'Simple Item' button.
    You should then see the following menu:
    </p>
    <img width="400px" src="item edit menu.png" />
    <p>As you can see, you can choose a 'Name' and a 'Display name'. The display name is the name players will see
        in-game.
        You can use uppercase characters and whitespaces within the display name to get it how you want it.
        You can also use the & character to use color codes in the display name if you like.
        The 'Name' of the item is like the name of textures, normal players won't see it in-game and you can't use
        special
        characters in it.
        However, server operators can see the names of all custom items using the '/customitems list' command and will
        need
        those names for the '/customitems give [custom item name]' command.
        For the 'Name', I will simply use 'ruby' and I will use 'Ruby' for the 'Display name'.
        Besides the name and display name, you will also need to select the Texture of the item.
        To select the texture, click on the 'None' button on the right of the 'Texture:' label.
        Then click on the 'ruby' label on the right of the ruby texture to choose it.
        As you can see, there are many other things like Attribute Modifiers and Item Flags.
        For the simply ruby item, we will ignore these, but we will explain some of them when creating the sword and
        pickaxe.
        Now click on the 'Create' button to add the ruby item to the item set.
    </p>
    <h3>The ruby sword</h3>
    <p>Now that you have added the ruby item, it's time to add the ruby sword.
        To start creating the sword, click on 'Create item' and then on 'Sword'.
        You should then see a menu similar to the menu where you created the ruby, but with even more options.
        The name and display name work the same as before, so you can just use 'Ruby Sword' as display name and
        'ruby_sword' as name.
        The texture also works the same as before, but choose ruby_sword as texture instead of just ruby.
    </p>
    <p>Until now, everything was basically the same as with the ruby item, but the next will be different.
        First, let's determine how much damage the ruby sword is going to deal.
        Changing the 'INTERNAL item damage' is <b>NOT</b> the way to do this.
        There are only 2 ways to do this, and these ways are Attribute modifiers and Default enchantments (with damage
        all/sharpness enchantment).
        Using default enchantments for this would prevent players from enchantment the sword because it will be
        enchanted immediathly when
        it is crafted (and you can't enchant items that already have enchantments). Also, it would look really dirty in
        general.
        The right way to do this is using Attribute modifiers.
        If you use them, everything will look normal.
        To start adding attribute modifiers, click on the 'Change...' button on the right of the 'Attribute modifiers:'
        label.
        Then click on the 'New Attribute' button. You should then see the following:
    </p>
    <img width="400px" src="attribute mods.png" />
    <p>Clicking on the red cross button on the left would remove the attribute modifiers from the item.
        If you clicked it, just click on 'New Attribute' again.
        The 'generic.attackDamage' is the attribute that determines the attack damage of players (and mobs), this is
        what you will need.
        If you click on it, you can choose another attribute modifier, but that's not what we want right now.
        The 'mainhand' is the slot where the attribute modifier will have effect.
        This means that players will get more attack damage when they hold the ruby sword in their main hand, which is
        exactly what we want.
        You could change the slot by clicking on it, but let's not do that now.
        The 'Add' means that this sword will <b>increase</b> the attack damage of the player by the value of this
        attribute modifier.
        This is also how normal swords work, so let's keep it as it is.
        Clicking on it allows you to choose another operation.
        The 'Value' is how much the attack damage of the wielder will be increased.
        This amount is given in half hearts, so the current value of 6 hearts means that the attack damage will be
        increased by 3 hearts.
        The default attack damage of players is a half heart, so the total damage when wielding the sword will be 3.5
        hearts.
        You can change the value if you want, but this value is quite reasonable, so I will keep it like this.
        Click on 'Apply' to confirm your changes and go back to the previous menu.
    </p>
    <p> Next, you should choose the durability of your sword (the number of hits you can deal before it breaks).
        You can do this by editing the edit field on the right of the 'Max uses:' label.
        If you give it the value -1, the sword will become unbreakable, so it will never break no matter how often you
        use it.
        You can also choose the 'Internal item type' of the ruby sword. For simple custom items, this value is not
        interesting.
        But for swords, this has some effect. To change it, click on the 'Iron sword' button on the right of the
        'Internal item type:'
        label. You should be able to choose all minecraft sword types. The internal item type is the item you will see
        when you disable
        the resource pack. For swords, it determines the enchantability and the block break speed. The enchantability is
        default minecraft
        behavior, it affects the levels of the enchantments the item will get when it is enchanted. For instance, stone
        swords will usually
        get lower enchantments than golden swords.
        The block break speed affects the speed at which the sword will be able to destroy blocks like cobwebs.
        (Breaking cobwebs with wooden swords takes more time than doing it with golden swords.)
        The ruby sword will get the same enchantability and block break speed as the internal item type has in normal
        minecraft.
        There are even more options to customize the sword, but this is all I will show in this tutorial.
        Click on 'Create' to add the sword to the item set.
    </p>
    <h3>The ruby pickaxe</h3>
    <p>Creating a pickaxe is almost the same as creating a sword, but there are some differences.
        Like the sword, click on 'Create item'. But then click on 'Pickaxe' instead of sword.
        Just like the ruby and the ruby sword, you can choose a name and a display name.
        Just like the ruby sword, you can use attribute modifiers to set the attack damage of the pickaxe.
        Also, you can set the max uses of the pickaxe just like the max uses of the sword.
        For the internal item type, there are some differences.
        Like swords, the internal item type determines enchantability and digging speed, but it also determines what
        ores you can mine with it.
        So the ruby pickaxe will only be able to mine obsidian if you choose 'Diamond pickaxe' as internal item type.
        Also, the digging speed is usually much more important for pickaxes than it is for swords.
        You could use default enchantments to increase the digging speed with the efficiency enchantment, but that will
        prevent
        players from enchanting the pickaxe.
        When you have chosen the values you like, click on the 'Create' button to also add the ruby pickaxe to the item
        set.
    </p>
    <h2>The crafting recipes</h2>
    <p>
        Now that you have created all the items, it's time to create their crafting recipes.
        To get started, click on the 'Back' button (if you are still in the item overview) and then click on the
        'Recipes' button.
        That should bring you to the (currently empty) recipes overview.
    </p>
    <h3>The ruby recipe</h3>
    <p>Let's first create a crafting recipe so that you can craft a ruby.
    I will simply use redstone dust and an emerald for this in this tutorial.
    Click on the 'Create shapeless recipe' button, you should then see the following menu:</p>
    <img width="400px" src="shapeless recipe edit.png" />
    <p>
        This is the menu for creating shapeless recipes. 
        For these recipes, it doesn't matter in which order players put the ingredients.
        Click on 'Add ingredient' to choose the first ingredient.
        You can use custom items and vanilla minecraft items in your recipes.
        In this recipe, we will only use vanilla minecraft items, so click on 'Simple vanilla item'.
        Then you will get to a menu where you can choose which vanilla item to use.
        I suggest using the search edit field under the 'Search:' label to spare yourself some long scrolling.
        Simply type 'emerald' there and the list of items should suddenly become very small.
        Then click on 'emerald', which should bring you back to the shapeless recipe edit, but now with an emerald as ingredient.
        Then add redstone as ingredient the same way you added emerald.
        So far the ingredients of the recipe, now it's time to set the result of the recipe.
        To change the result, click on the button below the 'Result' label. 
        The text of that button shows the current result of the recipe, which is currently a diamond because that's the default.
        Then click on the 'Change' button, which should bring you to a menu that seems familiar.
        The result will be a ruby, which is a custom item, so click on 'Custom Item'.
        Then click on 'Ruby', then on 'Select'. You should see that the text of the button below 'Result' has changed.
        Now that you have chosen the ingredients and results, you are done with the recipe, so click on 'Apply'.
    </p>
    <h3>The ruby sword recipe</h3>
    <p>
        Next, we will create a crafting recipe to create the ruby sword.
        This will be the basic sword recipe, so a stick at the bottom and a ruby in the middle and at the top.
        Because it matters in which shape players place the ingredients, it will be a shaped recipe.
        To start, click on 'Create shaped recipe', which should bring you to the following menu:
    </p>
    <img width="400px" src="shaped recipe edit.png" />
    <p>
        The 9 buttons containing 'empty' are supposed to represent the 3 by 3 crafting grid in-game.
        The text of the button on the right shows the current result of the crafting recipe, which is an iron ingot by default.
        But we want the result to be a ruby sword, so click on that button to change it.
        This should bring you to a menu that seems very familiar.
        Click on 'Change', then on 'Custom Item', then on 'ruby_sword' and then on 'Select'.
        Now its time to choose the ingredients of the recipe.
        Clicking on any button in the crafting grid will allow you to change the ingredient for that slot.
        Let's start by clicking on the bottom-middle 'empty' button and then on 'Change' and then 'Simple vanilla item'.
        Type 'stick' in the edit field below the 'Search:' label if you don't like scrolling all the way down to stick.
        Then click on 'stick'.
        The middle item in the grid should be a ruby, so click on the middle button, then 'Change', then 'Custom Item' and then 'ruby'.
        Do the same for the top-middle 'empty' button and then the recipe is done. 
        Click on 'Apply' to finish the recipe and add it to the item set.
    </p>
    <h3>The ruby pickaxe recipe</h3>
    <p>Adding the pickaxe recipe is pretty much the same process as adding the sword recipe, so I won't discuss this.</p>
    <h2>The block drop</h2>
    <p>There is a crafting recipe for the ruby, but I will also show you how to add a block drop for the ruby.
        Block drops allow you to give breaking blocks a chance to drop certain custom items.
        In this case, I will give emerald ore a 25% chance to drop a ruby instead of an emerald.
        To do this, click on 'Back' (if you are still in the recipe overview) and then on 'Drops' and then on 'Block drops'.
        That will bring you to the (currently empty) block drop overview.
        Click on 'New block drop' to start adding the ruby block drop.
        You should then see a simple menu to configure the block drop.
        To change the block that will drop the ruby, click on the button on the right of the 'Block:' label.
        I strongly recommend using the search field and type 'em' rather than scrolling through the entire list.
        Then click on 'emerald ore' to choose it.
        Now that we have chosen the block, it's time to configure the rest of the drop.
        Click on the 'None' button on the right of the 'Drop:' label.
        You should then see the following menu:
    </p>
    <img width="400px" src="drop edit.png" />
    <p>We want it to drop a ruby, so click on the 'None' button on the right of the 'Item to drop:' label and then on 'ruby'.
        We only want a 25% chance to drop a ruby upon breaking emerald ore, so replace the current 100% with 25%.
        Since we only want to drop a single ruby each time, we keep the minimum and maximum amount on 1.
        If you check 'Prevent other drops', no emerald will be dropped whenever a ruby is dropped.
        If you keep it unchecked, breaking emerald ore will always drop an emerald, but sometimes <b>also</b> a ruby.
        In this tutorial, I will check it.
        Now that we have configured everything, click on 'Apply' and then on 'Create'.
        The block drop should now be shown in the block drop overview:
    </p>
    <img width="400px" src="drop overview.png" />
    <h2>Exporting</h2>
    <p>The item set for this tutorial is now finished.
        In order to actually use the item set on a server, we need to export it first.
        First, click twice on the 'Back' button (if you are still in the block drop overview).
        Then, you need to click on the 'Export' button.
        If everything went well, you should be brought to the main menu.
        Then you can click on the 'Exit editor' button, which should close the editor.
        When you clicked on 'Export', the editor did a few things:
        <ul>
            <li>It saved the item set in the ruby.cisb file (or whatever you called your item set).
                The editor will need to read this file whenever you want to continue working on this item set.
                This file will contain all data about your item set and copies of all textures you loaded.
                If you encounter issues with the plug-in or editor, you should include this file when asking for help
                because it will contain everything I need.
                If you delete this file, you will need to use a back-up in order to continue working on the item set.
            </li>
            <li>It created a back-up of the ruby.cisb file within a 'backups' folder. If the backups folder start claiming
                too much disk space, you can delete older back-ups to reclaim the space.
            </li>
            <li>It created a ruby.cis file. This plug-in will need (a copy of) this file to be in the plugins/CustomItems folder.
                This file contains all data about the item set, but without the textures and eventual other resources.
                If you delete this file, you can recreate it by clicking 'Export' again.
            </li>
            <li>It created a ruby.zip file. This will be the (server) resourcepack for this item set. It will contain all textures
                and other resources of the item set, but not the data.
                If you delete this file, you can recreate it by clicking 'Export' again.
            </li>
        </ul>
        All these files should be located inside a 'Custom Item Sets' folder, which should be inside your documents folder.
    </p>
    <h2>Using the item set on a minecraft server</h2>
    <h3>Setting up the plug-in</h3>
    <p>
        This tutorial assumes that you already have a minecraft server to use the plug-in for.
        To use the plug-in, you need to download <a target="_blank" href="https://dev.bukkit.org/projects/custom-items-and-textures/files?filter-status=1&filter-game-version=">Custom Items</a>
        and <a target="_blank" href="https://dev.bukkit.org/projects/knokko-core/files">Knokko Core</a>.
        For custom items, you should pick the latest version (the plug-in, not the editor).
        In this tutorial, I am using CustomItems 5.5.
        For knokko core, you should pick the latest version for the minecraft version of your server.
        The first version after the 'Knokko Core' of each version indicates the minecraft version.
        You should put <b>both</b> plug-in jars in the plugins folder of your server. 
        (Really, you won't get far without Knokko Core.)
        Within the plugins folder, you should create a new folder called 'CustomItems'. 
        You need to put the ruby.cis file in that 'CustomItems' folder.

    <h3>Setting up the resource pack</h3>
    <p>
        For the server resourcepack, I recommend using <a target="_blank" href="https://minepack.net">minepack</a>.
        You can use this site to host resourcepacks for free, which is what we need because server resourcepacks must always
        be accessible from the internet. To use it, click on the 'Choose File' button.
        Then navigate to ruby.zip and select that file. Then click on the green 'Upload' button.
        After clicking that button, you should be able to copy the url and sha1 hash of the server resourcepack.
        Unfortunately, it appears that minepack deletes the resourcepacks if they aren't used in a while, so the resourcepack I uploaded
        already expired. (So you will really need to upload your resourcepack yourself.)
        The sha1 hash probably seems terrifying, but you don't need to know what it is, you will only need to copy and paste it.
        Now you need to modify your server.properties file and change the "resource-pack" and "resource-pack-sha1" to the values you copied.
        Then you should save your changes and (re)start the server.
    </p>
    <h3>Testing your item set</h3>
    <p>Once your server has (re)started, you should join it with your minecraft account.
        If nothing went wrong, everything should work now.
        When you are asked whether or not you want to use the server resourcepack, you should of course accept it.
        To test the crafting, pick some emeralds, some redstone dust, some sticks and a crafting table from your creative inventory.
        Place the crafting table and right click it. 
        When you put the redstone and emerald in the crafting matrix, you should see the ruby in the result slot and be able to take it.
        Craft a few more to test the ruby sword and pickaxe recipe.
        You might notice that stacking the rubies won't work well in creative mode, but it should work in survival mode.
        Finally, you can test the block drops by taking some emerald ore from your creative inventory and place some in the world.
        Don't bother going to survival mode because custom block drops will also work in creative mode.
        If you keep placing and breaking emerald ore, a ruby should be dropped soon (but remember there is only 25% per block).
