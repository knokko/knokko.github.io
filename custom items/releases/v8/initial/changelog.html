        <p>
            This is the changelog for Custom Items (and Editor) 8.0.
        </p>
        <ul>
            <li>
                <b>Backward compatibility in the plug-in</b>
                <p>
                    Until now, item stacks created with an older version of your
                    item set wouldn't update all of their properties once you 
                    upload a new item set to your server: if you change the 
                    attribute modifiers of a custom item, the item stacks created 
                    previously will keep their old value of that attribute modifier.
                    This would require you to replace all these items manually with 
                    a newer variant, or accept this suboptimal situation.
                </p>
                <p>
                    The problem sketched above is now solved, or... well... sort of.
                    All item stacks in your server that are created with a version of
                    the plugin before 8.0 will <b>no longer</b> be treated as custom 
                    items and will lose parts of their properties. This was needed
                    because I radically changed the way custom items are recognized.
                    On the bright side, all item stacks created with a version of the 
                    plugin at or after 8.0 will <b>automatically</b> receive updates
                    whenever you load a new version of your item set. In the current
                    implementation, the plugin will scan the inventory of all players
                    every 5 seconds and upgrade all old items it finds. It will do 
                    a best attempt to handle player modifications such as extra
                    enchantments and lost durability, but this behavior will not
                    always be exactly what you want (but should still be reasonable).
                    This comes with a couple of other changes:
                </p>
                <ul>
                    <li>
                        The INTERNAL item damage is from now on truly internal: you 
                        won't be able to see it or modify it (and thus never have 
                        to worry about it again.)
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        Item stacks belonging to custom items will store the name
                        of that custom item in their NBT, as well as some other 
                        information that it needs to perform good item upgrading.
                        The durability is from now on also stored in the NBT,
                        but is still visible in the lore.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        Changing the <b>name</b> of custom items is no longer
                        allowed. (When item stacks are created on the server, the 
                        name of its custom item is stored in its nbt. If that name 
                        would be changed, problems would occur...) Note that 
                        changing the <b>display name</b> is still allowed.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        When you delete a custom item, the plugin will also delete 
                        all item stacks that <i>belong</i> to that custom item.
                        Furthermore, once a custom item is deleted, it is no longer 
                        allowed to create new custom items with the name of that 
                        deleted custom item. (An item stack belonging to the deleted 
                        custom item might be locked away in some chest for a long time.
                        When a player would pick the item up, the plugin would think
                        that item would belong to the new custom item with the name of 
                        that deleted custom item...)
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        Decreasing the stack size of custom items is no longer allowed.
                        (If the custom item used to have a bigger stacksize, players 
                        might still be carrying such item stacks around...)
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        Due to this new upgrading system, the <b>old</b> command block 
                        help option is removed. (You shouldn't need it anymore and it 
                        causes problems because the NBT of custom item stacks is 
                        quite complex.)
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        To make the regular command block help more useful, the item 
                        upgrader will also upgrade the equipment of mobs when they 
                        spawn.
                    </li>
                </ul>
            </li>
            <li>
                <b>Armor appearence</b>
                <p>
                    This update also makes it possible to change the appearance of
                    worn custom armor... under the right circumstances.                 
                </p>
                <ul>
                    <li>
                        It adds 3d helmets. These are special custom items that are 
                        ironically <b>not</b> helmets, but you can still equip them
                        (the plugin will take care of that). This sounds silly, but 
                        it allows you to give it a custom item model, which will 
                        even be shown when the helmet is equipped! Unfortunately,
                        this is quite complicated because you will have to design 
                        the item model yourself. <b>Unless someone is nice enough
                        to publish a convenient model!</b>
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        It also adds <b>worn</b> armor textures. This allows you to
                        customize the armor texture that is displayed when players 
                        (or mobs) equip your custom armor. Unfortunately, they will 
                        only be visible to players with the Optifine mod installed.
                        And sorry Guaz, I'm afraid this ruins your first tutorial
                        a bit ;( <br>
                        But, I did follow that tutorial as the basis of my 
                        implementation.
                    </li>
                </ul>
            </li>
            <li>
                <b>Drops and output tables</b>
                <p>
                    This update also adds the possibility of randomness to custom 
                    containers, mob drops, and block drops, as well as some other 
                    related improvements. This randomness comes in the form of an
                    <b>output table</b>, which is basically a list of pairs of
                    possible outputs and the chance that particular output is chosen.
                </p>
                <ul>
                    <li>
                        Before this update, mob drops and block drops allowed some 
                        randomness: you were able to choose the chance to drop,
                        the minimum amount to drop, and the maximum amount to drop.
                        This system is replaced with output tables, which means you 
                        can decide the exact chance to drop which amount (and which 
                        item).
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        Custom containers didn't allow any randomness at all until 
                        this update. But with this update, the outputs of container 
                        recipes use output tables rather than just 1 item, so you 
                        can now truly implement random recipes. <b>Note: if multiple
                        different items can be dropped, the container will be blocked
                        whenever an item is put in a randomized output slot until 
                        the player removes that item from that randomized output 
                        slot.</b>
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        The new system for mob drops and block drops also makes it
                        possible to drop some items only when the player uses the 
                        right custom item to destroy the block or kill the mob.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        Until now, recipes were only able to produce custom items,
                        simple vanilla items, and vanilla items with a datavalue.
                        And even worse, mob drops and block drops could only drop 
                        custom items. This update adds the possibility to produce
                        a <b>complex</b> item: you can use any item stack on your 
                        server.
                    </li>
                </ul>
            </li>
            <li>
                <b>Remaining features</b>
                <p>
                    This update also adds a couple of features that are not really
                    related to each other:
                    <ul>
                        <li>
                            <b>Equipped potion effects</b>
                            <p>
                                Make it possible to give players potion effects as 
                                long as they are equipping the right custom item in 
                                the right slot.
                            </p>
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            <b>Attack range</b>
                            <p>
                                Makes it possible to change the attack range of a 
                                player when he has the right custom item in his
                                main hand. For instance spears with extra long range 
                                and daggers with a shorter range.
                            </p>
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            <b>Extra NBT</b>
                            <p>
                                Makes it possible to give additional NBT tags to 
                                custom items. This can be useful for interaction
                                with other plug-ins that check the NBT of items.
                                Currently, this is limited to adding integers and 
                                strings, but this can be improved if there is 
                                enough interest.
                            </p>
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            <b>Item aliases</b>
                            <p>
                                Until now, the <b>/ci give</b> command only accepts
                                the full names of custom items. But from now on,
                                they also accept the aliases of custom items. This 
                                can spare you time if your items have long names 
                                (and especially since renaming is no longer allowed).
                            </p>
                        </li>
                        <li>

                        </li>
                        <li>
                            <b>Placeholders for input, output, and fuel slots</b>
                            <p>
                                This update also makes it possible to give
                                placeholder items to input, output, and fuel slots 
                                of custom containers. These are items that will be 
                                shown when its slot does <b>not</b> container any 
                                items, but will vanish once the player inserts an
                                item.
                            </p>
                        </li>
                    </ul>
                </p>
            </li>
            <li>
                <b>Getting help</b>
                <p>
                    Note that almost every page in the Editor has a small question
                    mark button on the top-left of the window. Clicking it will open 
                    a webpage that explains everything on that page. Please use this 
                    before asking help with the new features.
                </p>
                <p>
                    When not everything works at your server, you can also use the 
                    <b>/kci debug</b> command. If your installation is not too
                    broken, this command will tell you if any startup errors occurred,
                    and will check your server resourcepack (get the url from 
                    your server.properties, try to download it, check that it is a 
                    valid resourcepack, check that the sha1 hash is correct...).
                </p>
            </li>
            <li>
                <b>Technical improvements</b>
                <p>
                    This update also introduces some technical improvements and 
                    bugfixes:
                </p>
                <ul>
                    <li>
                        You can now also use the <b>/kci ...</b> instead of just 
                        the <b>/ci ...</b> command. This is useful because the 
                        old one has some conflicts with an Essentials command.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        Until now, the images in the .cisb file were stored in 
                        a very simple, but expensive format: it took 4 bytes
                        per pixel. From now on, the editor will use the PNG 
                        format instead, which reduces the occupied disk space
                        dramatically.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        Those with a lot of items and containers might have noticed
                        that saving (and exporting) could take multiple seconds. I 
                        got rid of the most important performance bottleneck, which 
                        divides the time needed to save by ~10.
                    </li>

                        This update improves the way shift-clicking and
                        collect-to-cursor, and dragging inventory actions are 
                        handled in custom containers.

                    <li>
                        The Editor will perform 'system tests' upon startup: it will
                        check if it is able to do some actions like saving and
                        reading files. If it is not able to do so, the user will be
                        warned. (Some anti virus software seems to prevent the
                        Editor from doing this. Until now, people would see a red 
                        message on top of the editor upon exporting rather than 
                        a warning upfront.)
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        Improve the way custom containers handle custom lore and 
                        display names in slot displays.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        Container recipes will no longer proceed if one of the 
                        <b>unused</b> input slots is <b>not</b> empty.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        You can no longer delete custom items that are still being 
                        used in container recipes. In the past, this was allowed 
                        (by accident), and corrupted the entire item set.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        Improved the crafting and progress indicators of containers 
                        slightly (the stacksize is now more consistent).
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        Fixed a bug that would prevent custom containers from 
                        being reloaded when using the <b>/ci reload</b>
                        command.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        Fixed a bug that would occur when removing ingredients
                        from container recipes.
