        <p>
            This is the changelog for Custom Items (and Editor) 8.0.
        </p>
        <ul>
            <li>
                <b>Backward compatibility in the plug-in</b>
                <p>
                    Until now, item stacks created with an older version of your
                    item set wouldn't update all of their properties once you 
                    upload a new item set to your server: if you change the 
                    attribute modifiers of a custom item, the item stacks created 
                    previously will keep their old value of that attribute modifier.
                    This would require you to replace all these items manually with 
                    a newer variant, or accept this suboptimal situation.
                </p>
                <p>
                    The problem sketched above is now solved, or... well... sort of.
                    All item stacks in your server that are created with a version of
                    the plugin before 8.0 will <b>no longer</b> be treated as custom 
                    items and will lose parts of their properties. This was needed
                    because I radically changed the way custom items are recognized.
                    On the bright side, all item stacks created with a version of the 
                    plugin at or after 8.0 will <b>automatically</b> receive updates
                    whenever you load a new version of your item set. In the current
                    implementation, the plugin will scan the inventory of all players
                    every 5 seconds and upgrade all old items it finds. It will do 
                    a best attempt to handle player modifications such as extra
                    enchantments and lost durability, but this behavior will not
                    always be exactly what you want (but should still be reasonable).
                    This comes with a couple of other changes:
                </p>
                <ul>
                    <li>
                        The INTERNAL item damage is from now on truly internal: you 
                        won't be able to see it or modify it (and thus never have 
                        to worry about it again.)
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        Item stacks belonging to custom items will store the name
                        of that custom item in their NBT, as well as some other 
                        information that it needs to perform good item upgrading.
                        The durability is from now on also stored in the NBT,
                        but is still visible in the lore.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        Changing the <b>name</b> of custom items is no longer
                        allowed. (When item stacks are created on the server, the 
                        name of its custom item is stored in its nbt. If that name 
                        would be changed, problems would occur...) Note that 
                        changing the <b>display name</b> is still allowed.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        When you delete a custom item, the plugin will also delete 
                        all item stacks that <i>belong</i> to that custom item.
                        Furthermore, once a custom item is deleted, it is no longer 
                        allowed to create new custom items with the name of that 
                        deleted custom item. (An item stack belonging to the deleted 
                        custom item might be locked away in some chest for a long time.
                        When a player would pick the item up, the plugin would think
                        that item would belong to the new custom item with the name of 
                        that deleted custom item...)
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        Decreasing the stack size of custom items is no longer allowed.
                        (If the custom item used to have a bigger stacksize, players 
                        might still be carrying such item stacks around...)
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        Due to this new upgrading system, the <b>old</b> command block 
                        help option is removed. (You shouldn't need it anymore and it 
                        causes problems because the NBT of custom item stacks is 
                        quite complex.)
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        To make the regular command block help more useful, the item 
                        upgrader will also upgrade the equipment of mobs when they 
                        spawn.
                    </li>
                </ul>
            </li>
            <li>
                <b>Armor appearence</b>
                <p>
                    This update also makes it possible to change the appearance of
                    worn custom armor... under the right circumstances.                 
                </p>
                <ul>
                    <li>
                        It adds 3d helmets. These are special custom items that are 
                        ironically <b>not</b> helmets, but you can still equip them
                        (the plugin will take care of that). This sounds silly, but 
                        it allows you to give it a custom item model, which will 
                        even be shown when the helmet is equipped! Unfortunately,
                        this is quite complicated because you will have to design 
                        the item model yourself. <b>Unless someone is nice enough
                        to publish a convenient model!</b>
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        It also adds <b>worn</b> armor textures. This allows you to
                        customize the armor texture that is displayed when players 
                        (or mobs) equip your custom armor. Unfortunately, they will 
                        only be visible to players with the Optifine mod installed.
                        And sorry Guaz, I'm afraid this ruins your first tutorial
                        a bit ;( <br>
                        But, I did follow that tutorial as the basis of my 
                        implementation.
                    </li>
                </ul>
            </li>
            <li>
                <b>Drops and output tables</b>
                <p>
                    This update also adds the possibility of randomness to custom 
                    containers, mob drops, and block drops, as well as some other 
                    related improvements.
                </p>
                <ul>
                    <li>
                        Ehm...
                    </li>
                </ul>
            </li>
            <li>
                <b>Replacing items on right-click</b>
                <p>
                    This update has added the possibility to replace an item when you right click, based on conditions you can specify beforehand. You can make these conditions as simple or 
                    complex as you want, requiring for instance the presence of at least 1 other item, or having multiple conditions requiring several items to be present and/or missing. Now 
                    your complex resource swapping mechanism can be implemented, hooray!
                </p>
