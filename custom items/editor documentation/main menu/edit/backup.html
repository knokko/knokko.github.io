        <p>
            In the back-up selection menu, you can load a back-up of an item set on your computer.
            If you have a single item set called <i>damage_source_test</i>, it should look like this:
        </p>
        <img src="backup.png" width="50%" />
        <p>
            When you click on the name of an item set, all of its back-ups should be shown on the right,
            which should look like this:
        </p>
        <img src="backup saves.png" width="50%" />
        <p>
            In the list on the right, you can see which back-ups of your item set are available. The timestamps
            show when that particular back-up was made. By clicking the corresponding <b>Load</b> button, you
            can load the corresponding back-up. When you load a back-up, you can make changes to your items
            (just like when you edit an item set). If you <b>Save</b> or <b>Export</b>, the back-up version
            will become your 'default' version.
        </p>
        <p>
            Whenever you save an item set with the editor, it will automatically create a back-up for the item set
            you're saving as well. Old back-ups will automatically be removed after some time. More precisely:
        </p>
        <ul>
            <li>Back-ups less than 24 hours old will not be deleted</li>
            <li>
                When back-ups are between 1 and 30 days old, only the most recent back-up of each day will be kept.
            </li>
            <li>
                When back-ups are older than 30 days, only the most recent back-up of each week will be kept.
            </li>
        </ul>
        <p>
            The back-up system has 2 purposes:
            <ul>
                <li>Allowing you to load an older version if you aren't happy with the changes you recently made.</li>
                <li>Allowing you to load an older version if the most recent version got corrupted due to me messing things up.</li>
            </ul>
            I must admit that the latter case was my primary motivation for adding this back-up system.
        </p>

            Note: all these automatic back-ups are stored on YOUR computer, so they won't help you if your entire
            disk gets corrupted. If you want to protect your content from being lost when your disk is damaged, you
            should copy your .cis<i>b</i> file to some service like Onedrive or Dropbox.
