        <p>
            In the back-up selection menu, you can load a back-up of an item set on your computer.
            If you have quite some back-ups of an item set called 'armor_test', it could look like this:
        </p>
        <img src="backup.png" width="50%" />
        <p>
            Whenever you save an item set with the editor, it will automatically create a back-up for the item set
            you're saving as well. Currently, there is no bound on the number of back-ups that are made and they will
            not be deleted automatically. If this starts taking too much disk space (shouldn't happen that soon), you
            can go to YourDocumentsFolder/Custom Item Sets/backups and delete some back-up files (or just delete the entire backups folder).
        </p>
        <p>
            The back-up system has 2 purposes:
            <ul>
                <li>Allowing you to load an older version if you aren't happy with the changes you recently made.</li>
                <li>Allowing you to load an older version if the most recent version got corrupted due to me messing things up.</li>
            </ul>
            I must admit that the latter case was my primary motivation for adding this back-up system.
        </p>
        <p>
            This menu has 2 basic buttons 'Refresh' and 'Back' as well as a button for every back-up that has been made.
            Note that you can 'scroll' with the up/down array key and the mouse wheel, which you will need when you have
            a lot of back-ups.
            The 'Back' button will bring you back to the <a href="selection.html">item set selection menu</a> and the 'Refresh'
            button will refresh the list of back-ups.
            
        </p>
        <p>
            Each back-up button consists of an item set and the time at which the back-up was made.
            Clicking on any of the back-up buttons will bring you to the <a href="../../edit menu/index.html">item set edit menu</a>
            for the chosen item set at the time the chosen back-up was made. 
            Then, you can make changes to the item set if you would like to.
            If you quit without clicking on the Save button or any Export button, loading the back-up won't have any effect.<br>
            If you do Save or Export the (possibly modified) back-up, it will become the new 'latest' version of the item set,
            so whenever you open the Editor, click 'Edit item set' and then click the item set, you will load that back-up instead
            of the 'original latest' version.
