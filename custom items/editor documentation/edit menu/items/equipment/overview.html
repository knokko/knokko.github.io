            The equipment set overview shows all your <i>equipment sets</i>. An equipment set is a collection of
            related equipment (for instance custom ruby helmet, chestplate, leggings, and boots). You can configure
            bonuses (for instance extra armor or health) when a player (or mob) equips multiple pieces of the
            equipment set (for instance both a ruby chestplate and helmet). This menu should look like this:
        </p>
        <img src="overview.png" width="50%" />
        <p>
            There are 3 elements on the left of this menu:
        </p>
        <ul>
            <li>The <i>Back</i> button, which takes you back to the <a href="../overview.html">item overview</a>.</li>
            <li>
                The <i>Search</i> field, which filters out equipment sets whose description does <b>not</b> contain the
                text within the search field. This is useful if you have lots of equipment sets.
            </li>
            <li>
                The <i>Create equipment set</i> will take you to the <a href="edit.html">equipment set edit menu</a>,
                where you can create a new equipment set.
            </li>
        </ul>
        <p>
            Furthermore, there are 3 buttons for each equipment set you have made:
        </p>
        <ul>
            <li>
                The <i>Edit</i> button will take you to the <a href="edit.html">equipment set edit menu</a>,
                where you can edit the corresponding equipment set.
            </li>
            <li>The <i>Copy</i> button will (instantly) copy the corresponding equipment set.</li>
            <li>The <i>Delete</i> button will (instantly) delete the corresponding equipment set.</li>
        </ul>
