            The equipment set edit menu can be used to edit an <i>equipment set</i>. An equipment set has a collection of
            <i>Equipment items</i> and <i>Equipment bonuses</i>. An example equipment set is shown below:
        </p>
        <img src="edit.png" width="50%" />
        <h3>Equipment items</h3>
        <p>
            The <i>equipment items</i> determine which items are part of the equipment set, in which slot it needs to be
            put, and how important each of these items is. When an equipment item is in the wrong slot (for instance
            when a player holds a chestplate in their main hand), the equipment item will <b>not</b> count towards the
            bonuses. In the example configuration shown in the screenshot above:
        </p>
        <ul>
            <li>Holding a ruby sword in your main hand is worth 1 point</li>
            <li>Equipping a ruby chestplate in your chest slot is worth 2 points</li>
            <li>Equipping a ruby helmet in your helmet slot is woth 1 point</li>
            <li>Equipping a pair of ruby leggings in your leg slot is worth 2 points</li>
            <li>Equipping a pair of ruby boots in your boots slot is worth 1 point</li>
        </ul>
        <p>
            The <b>total number of points</b> determines which <i>equipment bonuses</i> players will get. When a player
            equips ruby leggings and a ruby helmet, and holds a ruby sword in their main hand, there 
            <b>total number of points</b> would be 2 + 1 + 1 = 4.
        </p>
        <h3>Equipment bonuses</h3>
        <p>
            The <i>Equipment bonuses</i> are the bonuses (or punishments) when a player equips the right
            <i>equipment items</i>. Each equipment bonus has:
        </p>
        <ul>
            <li>
                A minimum value: only players whose <b>total number of points</b> is <i>at least</i> the minimum value
                will get the bonus.
            </li>
            <li>
                A maximum value: only players whose <b>total number of points</b> is <i>at most</i> the maximum value
                will get the bonus.
            </li>
            <li>
                A list of attribute modifiers: players will get these attribute modifiers while they have the right
                number of points.
            </li>
            <li>
                Damage resistances: these damage resistances will be added to the damage resistances of players who
                have the right number of points.
            </li>
        </ul>
        <p>
            In the example shown in the screenshot, there are 2 equipment bonuses: the first one is given to players
            whose <b>total number of points</b> is exactly 4 and the second one is given to players whose
            total number of points is between 5 and 10. Note that the maximum number of points any player can have is
            1 + 2 + 1 + 2 + 1 = 7 (which is smaller than 10), so the second one will be given to any player who has at 
            least 5 points.
        </p>
        <p>
            The attribute modifiers and the damage resistances can be seen by clicking on the <i>Attribute modifiers...</i>
            and <i>Damage resistances...</i> buttons. These determine the actual bonuses that will be given to the players.
