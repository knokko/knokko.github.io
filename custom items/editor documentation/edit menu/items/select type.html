            The custom item type selection is the menu where you need to select what kind of custom item you would like
            to create. It should look like this:
        </p>
        <img src="select type.png" width="50%" />
        <p>
            There is a 'Cancel' button and a button for each custom item type currently supported by the plug-in
            and editor. The 'Cancel' button will bring you back to the <a href="overview.html">item overview</a>
            without adding a new custom item. All other buttons will bring you to the item edit menu for that specific
            kind of custom item.
        </p>
        <p>
            As you can see, there is plenty of choice: you can create almost every tool in the game.
            Currently, 'Simple item' is the only type of custom item that is <b>not</b> considered a tool.
            This means that they can stack (only in survival mode), but can't have durability. All other 
            types of custom items are considered tools and therefore can't stack, but can lose durability.<br>
            I will list all possibilities alongside a brief description:
            <ul>
                <li>
                    'Simple item' is for custom items that are not tools and the only kind of custom item that

                    'Sword' is for custom swords. Custom swords are tools, but don't have anything special aside

                    property aside from the basic tool properties. The corresponding edit menu is the <a href="edit/hoe.html">hoe edit menu</a>.

                </li>
