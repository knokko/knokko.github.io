    <body>
        <p>
            The custom item type selection is the menu where you need to select what kind of custom item you would like
            to create. It should look like this:
        </p>
        <img src="select type.png" width="50%" />
        <p>
            There is a 'Cancel' button and a button for each custom item type currently supported by the plug-in
            and editor. The 'Cancel' button will bring you back to the <a href="overview.html">item overview</a>
            without adding a new custom item. All other buttons will bring you to the item edit menu for that specific
            kind of custom item.
        </p>
        <p>
            As you can see, there is plenty of choice: you can create almost every tool in the game.
            I will list all possibilities alongside a brief description:
            <ul>
                <li>
                    'Food or Potion' is for custom food or custom potions. These are custom 
                    items that can mimic food and potions: they can be eaten/drunk, display a 
                    sound while being eaten/drunk and restore hunger or give potion effects
                    upon finishing eating/drinking it. The corresponding edit menu is the 
                    <a href="edit/food.html">food edit menu</a>.
                </li>
                <li>
                    'Simple item' is for custom items that are not tools and the only kind of custom item that
                    can stack. The corresponding edit menu is the <a href="edit/simple.html">simple item edit menu</a>.
                </li>
                <li>
                    'Sword' is for custom swords. Custom swords are tools, but don't have anything special aside 
                    from that. The corresponding edit menu is the <a href="edit/tool.html">tool edit menu</a>.
                </li>
                <li>
                    'Pickaxe' is for custom pickaxes. Custom pickaxes are tools, but don't have anything special aside 
                    from that. The corresponding edit menu is the <a href="edit/tool.html">tool edit menu</a>.
                </li>
                <li>
                    'Axe' is for custom axes. Custom axes are tools, but don't have anything special aside 
                    from that. The corresponding edit menu is the <a href="edit/tool.html">tool edit menu</a>.
                </li>
                <li>
                    'Shovel' is for custom shovels/spades. Custom shovels are tools, but don't have anything special aside 
                    from that. The corresponding edit menu is the <a href="edit/tool.html">tool edit menu</a>.
                </li>
                <li>
                    'Hoe' is for custom hoes. Custom hoes are tools, but have an additional 'Durability loss on tilling'
                    property aside from the basic tool properties. The corresponding edit menu is the <a href="edit/hoe.html">hoe edit menu</a>.
                </li>
                <li>
                    'Shear' is for custom shears. Custom shears are tools, but have an additional 'Durability loss on shearing'
                    property aside from the basic tool properties. The corresponding edit menu is the <a href="edit/shear.html">shear edit menu</a>.
                </li>
                <li>
                    'Bow' is for custom bows. Custom bows shoot arrows like normal bows, but can have their own texture
                    and fire arrows with different speed or damage. The corresponding edit menu is the <a href="edit/bow.html">bow edit menu</a>.
                </li>
                <li>
                    'Shield' is for custom shields. Custom shields can block damage just like normal shields, but their durability 
                    behavior is more configurable (and they can have their own texture).
                    The corresponding edit menu is the <a href="edit/shield.html">shield edit menu</a>.
                </li>
                <li>
                    '3D helmet' is for custom helmets with a custom model when equipped.
                    This is the only custom item that <b>requires</b> a custom model,
                    which makes it one of the hardest items to create. The corresponding 
                    edit menu is the <a href="edit/helmet3d.html">3d helmet edit menu</a>.
                </li>
                <li>
                    'Helmet' is for custom helmets, but without a custom worn model or texture. 
                    Use '3D helmet' if you really want this. The number of armor point is configurable 
                    either way. The corresponding edit menu is the 
                    <a href="edit/armor.html">armor edit menu</a>.
                </li>
                <li>
                    'Chestplate' is for custom chestplates. Custom chestplates can unfortunately not have a custom model texture,
                    but the number of armor points are configurable. The corresponding edit menu is the 
                    <a href="edit/armor.html">armor edit menu</a>.
                </li>
                <li>
                    'Leggings' is for custom leggings. Custom leggings can unfortunately not have a custom model texture,
                    but the number of armor points are configurable. The corresponding edit menu is the 
                    <a href="edit/armor.html">armor edit menu</a>.
                </li>
                <li>
                    'Boots' is for custom boots. Custom boots can unfortunately not have a custom model texture,
                    but the number of armor points are configurable. The corresponding edit menu is the 
                    <a href="edit/armor.html">armor edit menu</a>.
                </li>
                <li>
                    'Elytra' is for custom elytra. Players can fly using custom elytra and you can configure the glide
                    behavior of custom elytra. For instance, you can make them faster or slower. Like all custom items,
                    you can give them a custom inventory texture. However, the worn/equipped texture can only be changed
                    for players who use Optifine. Unlike vanilla elytra, custom elytra will be <b>destroyed</b> when their
                    durability reaches 0. You can also configure custom elytra to have attribute modifiers and damage
                    resistances. The corresponding edit menu is the <a href="edit/elytra.html">elytra edit menu</a>.
                </li>
                <li>
                    'Trident (1.13 and 1.14)' is for custom tridents. Custom tridents can be thrown just like normal tridents,
                    but will lose their special texture as soon as they are thrown. As the name suggests, it's only for 
                    minecraft servers with version 1.13 and 1.14. They are not available before 1.13 because minecraft 
                    didn't have normal tridents before 1.13 and custom tridents are not available after 1.14 because minecraft
                    introduced a resourcepack bug in 1.15 that doesn't seem to be solved, even in 1.16. 
                    The corresponding edit menu is the <a href="edit/trident.html">trident edit menu</a>.
                </li>
                <li>
                    'Crossbow (1.14+)' is for custom crossbows. Custom crossbows are 
                    similar to regular crossbows, but can have their own texture and 
                    fire bolts with different power and speed. Custom crossbows 
                    are only available in minecraft 1.14.x and later because regular 
                    crossbows were introduced in minecraft 1.14.
                </li>
                <li>
                    'Block (1.13+)' is for custom block items. These are items that
                    can be used to <i>place</i> custom blocks and will take on the 
                    texture and model of their block. They are only available in 
                    minecraft 1.13.x and later because the texture system is based
                    on a minecraft mechanic that was introduced in minecraft 1.13.
                    <b>Note: you need to create the corresponding block first.</b>
                </li>
                <li>
                    'Music disc (1.14+)' is used for custom music discs. These are items that can
                    be put in a jukebox, after which they will play their (custom) sound or music.
                    They are only available in minecraft 1.14 or later because they must use real music
                    discs as their internal item type, and non-tool internal item types can only be
                    retextured in minecraft 1.14 and later.
                </li>
                <li>
                    'Arrow (1.14+)' is used for custom arrows. These arrows can be fired from both vanilla
                    (cross)bows and custom (cross)bows. You can configure their damage, speed, as well as
                    some special attack effects. They have a custom inventory texture, but unfortunatley no
                    custom entity textures. They are only available in minecraft 1.14 or later
                    because they need to be real arrows, and overriding non-tool items is only possible
                    in minecraft 1.14 and later.
                </li>
                <li>
                    'Wand' is for (custom) wands. Wands have the ability to shoot custom projectiles, but are basic custom 
                    items aside from that. Note that you need to create a custom projectile before you can create a wand.
                    The corresponding edit menu is the <a href="edit/wand.html">wand edit menu</a>.
                </li>
                <li>
                    'Gun' is for (custom) guns. Guns can shoot custom projectiles, but consume
                    ammo when doing so. Note that you need to create a custom projectile 
                    before you can create a custom gun. The corresponding edit menu is the 
                    <a href="edit/gun.html">gun edit menu</a>.
                </li>
                <li>
                    'Throwable' is for custom items that players can throw. Throwing a custom item will launch a
                    custom projectile and decrement its own stacksize. Note that you need to create a custom projectile
                    before you can create a throwable custom item. The corresponding edit menu is the
                    <a href="edit/throwable.html">throwable edit menu</a>.
                </li>
                <li>
                    'Pocket container' is for (custom) pocket containers. These are 
                    custom items that will open a custom container when players
                    right-click it. (See the <i>Containers</i> button on the 
                    <a href="../index.html">edit menu</a> for more information
                    about custom containers.) The corresponding edit menu is the
