            The custom item type selection is the menu where you need to select what kind of custom item you would like
            to create. It should look like this:
        </p>
        <img src="select type.png" width="50%" />
        <p>
            There is a 'Cancel' button and a button for each custom item type currently supported by the plug-in
            and editor. The 'Cancel' button will bring you back to the <a href="overview.html">item overview</a>
            without adding a new custom item. All other buttons will bring you to the item edit menu for that specific
            kind of custom item.
        </p>
        <p>
            As you can see, there is plenty of choice: you can create almost every tool in the game.
            I will list all possibilities alongside a brief description:
            <ul>
                <li>
                    'Simple item' is for custom items that are not tools and the only kind of custom item that
                    can stack. The corresponding edit menu is <a href="edit/simple.html">simple item edit menu</a>.
                </li>
            </ul>
        </p>
    </body>
