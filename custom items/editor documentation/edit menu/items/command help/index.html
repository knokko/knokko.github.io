            The command block help page is made to help developers with using custom items in commands like
            /give and /summon. It should look like this:
        </p>
        <img src="index.png" width="50%" />
        <p>
            Currently, this page has a 'Back' button that will bring you back to the <a href="../overview.html">item overview</a>
            as well as 3 buttons leading to pages for some example commands. I will not explain these pages any further because
            they contain a good description in the pages themselves.
