            The hoe edit menu can be used to create or edit custom hoes.
            If you just started creating a new hoe, it should look like this:
        </p>
        <img src="hoe.png" width="50%" />
        <p>
            This menu has everything the <a href="tool.html">tool edit menu</a> has, but an
            additional 'Durability loss on tilling', which determines how much durability 
            the hoe will lose each time a player uses it to till dirt.
            See the section about the 'Max uses' and durability in the tool edit menu for more
            information about that.
