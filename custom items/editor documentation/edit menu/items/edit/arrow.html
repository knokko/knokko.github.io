        <p>
            The arrow edit menu can be used to create custom arrows. Just like vanilla arrows, custom arrows can be
            fired from both custom (cross)bows and vanilla (cross)bows, but custom arrows have customizable damage,
            speed, and special effects. This menu should look like this:

            All properties on the left of this page are explained
            <a href="base.html">here</a>. The properties on the right of this page
            are unique to custom arrows and are explained below:
        </p>
        <h3>Maximum stacksize</h3>
        <p>
            The maximum stacksize of this custom arrow in the player inventory.
        </p>
        <h3>Damage multiplier</h3>
        <p>
            How much damage this arrow will deal compared to vanilla arrows. When this is 1, this custom arrow
            deals the same damage as vanilla arrows. When this is 0.5, it only deals half of the damage. When
            this is 2, it deals twice the damage...
        </p>
        <h3>Speed multiplier</h3>
        <p>
            How fast this arrow is compared to vanilla arrows. When this is 1, the custom arrow will be equally fast
            as vanilla arrows. When this is 0.5, the custom arrow will be twice as slow as vanilla arrows. When this
            is 2, the custom arrow will be twice as fast as vanilla arrows. Note: the damage of an arrow will be larger
            when it hits the target at higher speed, so increasing the speed multiplier will implicitly also
            increase the damage.
        </p>
        <h3>Knockback strength</h3>
        <p>
            How far this arrow will knock the target away. The knockback strength will basically be added to the
            punch enchantment level. For instance, if the arrow has knockback strength 1 and the bow has
            punch 1, the custom arrow will give the same knockback as a vanilla arrow fired from a bow with punch 2.
            If you give the custom arrow knockback strength 0, it will have the same knockback as a vanilla arrow. If
            you give it a negative knockback strength, it will reduce the effective punch enchantment level.
        </p>
        <h3>Is affected by gravity</h3>
        <p>
            Whether this custom arrow is affected by gravity. If you uncheck this, the arrow will ignore gravity
            and thus fly in a straight line.
        </p>
        <h3>Shoot effects</h3>
        <p>
            Shoot effects can be used to configure special effects that will happen when someone is struck by this
            custom arrow. Examples of special effects are knockback/knock-up, potion effects, and setting
            the target (or attacker) on fire. See <a href="../../attack/effect/group list.html">this page</a> for more
            information.
        </p>
        <h3>Custom shoot damage source</h3>
        <p>
            What kind of <a href="../damage source/overview.html">custom damage</a> this arrow should deal when someone
            is shot using this arrow. By default, this is <b>None</b>, which means that the bow will determine which type
            of custom damage is used.
