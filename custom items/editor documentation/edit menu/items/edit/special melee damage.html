        <p>
            The Special melee damage menu allows you to configure the melee attack properties of its corresponding custom item.
            It you just checked the checkbox, this menu should look like this:
        </p>
        <img src="special melee damage.png" width="50%" />
        <ul>
            <li>The <i>Cancel</i> button will take you back to the previous menu, <b>without</b> keeping the changes made here.</li>
            <li>The <i>Apply</i> button will take you back to the previous menu and <b>keep</b> the changes made here.</li>
            <li>
                The <i>Use special melee damage source</i> checkbox allows you to enable/disable special melee damage. If you
                don't want to use anything special, it is best to leave this checkbox unchecked. The other options in this menu
                are only visible if this checkbox is checked.
            </li>
            <li>
                The <i>raw damage source</i> (see the <i>None</i> button in the screenshot) determines the death message when a
                player is killed by a melee attack with this custom item. If you want to keep the default death message, you
                should keep it <i>None</i>.
            </li>
            <li>
                If you have chosen a custom <i>raw damage source</i>, a red cross will appear on the left that allows you to
                reset the raw damage source to <i>None</i>.
            </li>
            <li>
                The <i>Ignores armor</i> checkbox determines whether melee attacks with this custom item will ignore the armor
                of the target.
            </li>
            <li>
                The <i>Is fire</i> checkbox determines whether melee attacks with this custom item will deal fire damage or
                regular damage. If you choose for <i>fire</i> damage, melee attacks with this custom item will have <b>no</b>
                effect against mobs that are immune to fire damage (like magma cubes and wither skeletons) as well as anyone
                that has the <i>Fire resistance</i> potion effect. Furthermore, attacks with this custom item will deal less
                damage against anyone that equips armor with the <i>Fire protection</i> enchantment. This option makes no
                difference against targets with no fire protection.
            </li>
        </ul>
