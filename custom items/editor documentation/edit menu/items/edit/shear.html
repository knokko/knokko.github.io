            The shear edit menu can be used to create or edit custom shears.
            If you just started creating a new shear, it should look like this:
        </p>
        <img src="shear.png" width="50%" />
        <p>
            This menu has everything the <a href="tool.html">tool edit menu</a> has, but an
            additional 'Durability loss on shearing', which determines how much durability 
            the shear will lose each time a player uses it to obtain wool from a sheep.
            See the section about the 'Max uses' and durability in the tool edit menu for more
            information about that.
