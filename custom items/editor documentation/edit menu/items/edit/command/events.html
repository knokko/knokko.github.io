            Custom items can be configured to execute commands when certain <i>events</i> happen. This page lists all <i>events</i>
            that you can use. Note that you can scroll down to see more events. It should look like this:
        </p>
        <img src="events.png" width="50%" />
        <ul>
            <li>
                Clicking the 'Cancel' button will take you back to the item edit menu and <b>discard</b> all changes you made to the 
                commands.
            </li>
            <li>
                Clicking the 'Done' button will take you back to the item edit menu and <b>keep</b> all changes you made to the
                commands.
            </li>
        </ul>
        <p>
            Each event has a display name (top left), description (bottom) and a <b>Commands...</b> button (top right). Clicking the
            button will take you to the <a href="list.html">command list</a>, where you can configure the commands for the corresponding
            event.
