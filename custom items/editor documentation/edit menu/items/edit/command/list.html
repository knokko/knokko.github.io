        <p>
            The command list can be used to configure the commands that will be executed if the corresponding <i>event</i> occurs for 
            the corresponding custom item. It should look like this:
        </p>
        <img src="list.png" width="50%" />
        <h3>Available substitutions</h3>
        <p>
            The top of the page shows which <i>substitutions</i> are available for this event. The available substitutions differ
            per event, but the first 8 substitutions (<b>%player_name%</b>, <b>%world_name%</b>, ...) are available for all events.
            Substitutions are special text patterns that you can put inside commands, and will be replaced with something else when the 
            command is executed. For instance, the substitution <b>%player_name%</b> will be replaced with the name of the player that 
            holds the custom item. So if you would configure the command to be <b>give %player_name% stick</b> and player <i>knokko</i> 
            uses the custom item, the final command will be <b>give knokko stick</b>, which will give knokko a single stick.
        </p>
        <h3>General buttons</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>
                The 'Cancel' button will take you back to the <a href="events.html">command event list</a> and <b>discard</b> all 
                changes you made on this page.
            </li>
            <li>
                The 'Apply' button will take you back to the <a href="events.html">command event list</a> and <b>keep</b> all changes 
                you made on this page.
            </li>
            <li>
                The 'Add new' button will add a new empty command. You need to configure this command before you click 'Apply'.
            </li>
        </ul>
        <h3>Per-command properties</h3>
        <p>
            For each command, you can configure the following properties:
            <ul>
                <li>
                    The raw command that will be executed. This is the upper text edit field.
                </li>
                <li>
                    The entity that should execute the command. This can be either the <b>console</b> or the <b>player</b>. If you 
                    choose to use the <b>player</b>, you need to ensure that the player will have the right permissions to execute the 
                    command! You can change this command executor by clicking the (Console) button on the bottom-left.
                </li>
                <li>
                    The chance that the command will be executed (the percentage). You <b>are allowed</b> to use non-integer chances
                    as well as integer chances. If you keep it 100%, the command will always be executed when the event occurs.
                </li>
                <li>
                    The cooldown of the command, in <b>ticks</b>. 1 second = 20 ticks! For instance, when the cooldown is 100 ticks
                    and the event occurs, the command can only be executed once every 5 seconds. Players can <b>not</b> use multiple 
                    item stacks of this custom item to bypass the cooldown (all item stacks of the same custom item share the same 
                    cooldown).
                </li>
                <li>
                    <i>Activate cooldown when chance fails</i>. This property is only relevant when the chance is smaller than 100% and 
                    the cooldown is larger than 0. It determines what happens when the event occurs, but the command is not executed 
                    due to the <i>Chance</i>. Consider the case when the chance is 50% and the cooldown is 100 ticks. When the event
                    occurs, there is 50% that the command will be executed. If the command is executed, it can't be executed again
                    during the next 5 seconds, regardless of whether this checkbox is checked. When the command is <b>not executed</b>,
                    this checkbox determines what will happen:
                    <ul>
                        <li>
                            If the checkbox is checked, the command can <b>not</b> be executed during the next 5 seconds.
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            If the checkbox is <b>not</b> checked, the command can still be executed if the event occurs again within
                            5 seconds.
                        </li>
                    </ul>
                </li>
            </ul>
        </p>
