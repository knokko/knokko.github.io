            In the projectile selection menu, you can select which custom projectile your wand should shoot.
            If you have a single custom projectile called 'blaze_ball', it should look like this:
        </p>
        <img src="projectile selection.png" width="50%" />
        <p>
            This menu has a 'Cancel' button and a button for every custom projectile that has been created
            already. So if you haven't created any custom projectiles yet, you will only see the 'Cancel' button.
        </p>
        <p>
            Clicking on the 'Cancel' button will take you back to the previous <a href="wand.html">wand edit menu</a>
            without selecting a new projectile. Clicking on any of the projectile buttons will select that projectile 
            and then take you back to the wand edit menu.
