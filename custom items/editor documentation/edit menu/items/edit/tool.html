        <p>
            The tool edit menu can be used to edit or create tools.
            If you just started creating a new pickaxe, it should look like this:
        </p>
        <img src="tool.png" width="50%" />
        <p>
            This menu contains everything the <a href="base.html">base item edit menu</a> has,
            but more. For a description of all other properties, check the link to the base item edit menu.
            Additionally, this menu contains the common properties for all custom tools.
            I will give a description of each property.
        </p>
        <h3>Allow enchanting</h3>
        <p>
            Whether this custom item can be enchanted in an enchantment table.
            <ul>
                <li>If this is disabled, players can't enchant this custom item in an enchanting table. </li>
                <li>
                    If this is enabled, players can enchant this custom item in an enchanting table 
                    under the same conditions as which players can enchant a normal tool (they need
                    enough xp, lapiz and the item must not be enchanted already).
                </li>
            </ul>
            That yellow thing on the left of 'Allow enchanting' is supposed to look like a checkbox.
            Checking it will enable enchanting and unchecking it will disable enchanting.
            If this checkbox is checked, the custom tool is not allowed to have any default enchantments
            (if it has default enchantments, the item is always enchanted and can therefore not be 
            enchanted in an enchantint table).
        </p>
        <h3>Allow anvil actions</h3>
        <p>
            Whether this custom item can be manipulated (repaired, renamed, enchanted...) in an anvil.
            <ul>
                <li>If this is disabled, players won't be able to modify this custom item in an anvil at all.</li>
                <li>
                    If this is enabled, the plug-in will try to give the custom item the same behavior in the anvil 
                    as a normal tool of that type. This works correctly most of the time, but sometimes repair costs
                    are not displayed correctly (if that happens, players can just close the anvil gui and right click it again).
                    Also, there are a few more minor issues where players can get kicked out of the anvil GUI (luckily without damage).
                </li>
            </ul>
        </p>
        <h3>Max uses and durability losses</h3>
        <p>
            The 'Max uses', 'Durability loss and attack' and 'Durability loss on block break' (some tools like tridents and bows
            have even more of those) determine how many times the custom tool can be used before it breaks. Each time a custom tool 
            is created in-game, it will start with a durability equal to the 'Max uses'. Each time a player attack someone (left-clicks)
            with the tool, the durability will decrease by its 'Durability loss on attack'. Similarly, each time the player breaks a block 
            with the tool, the durability will decrease by its 'Durability loss on block break'.
        </p>
        <p>
            The default value of 'Max uses' will always be 500, but you should change this value to whatever you want it to be.
            The default values of the durability losses will be equal to the values normal minecraft tools would have (
            for instance, a pickaxe will lose twice as much durability when it's being used as weapon rathern than
            being used to break blocks.) You can change these values if you would like, but should normally not do that.
            You can even change (some of) those values to 0, which would indicate no durability loss at all.
            If you would set them all to 0, the tool would become basically unbreakable, <b>but you should set the 'Max uses'
            to -1 instead if you want to make the tool unbreakable.</b>
        </p>
        <h3>Repair item</h3>
        <p>
            The item that can be used to repair this custom tool in an anvil.
            If anvil actions are not enabled, the repair item doesn't matter because it can't be used anyway.
            To change the repair item, click on the button on the right of 'Repair item:' (initially, it will have 
            text 'None'). Clicking it will take you to the item type selection menu.
