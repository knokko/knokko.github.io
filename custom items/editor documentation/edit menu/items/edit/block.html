            The block edit menu can be used to create or modify <i>block items</i>. 
            These are items that will place a custom block when a player right-clicks 
            them against a block. <b>Note: you need to create a custom block before 
            you can create a <i>block item</i>.</b> If you just started creating a new 
            block item, it should look like this:
        </p>
        <img src="block.png" width="50%" />
        <p>
            The only properties unique to block items are the <i>Block</i> and the
            <i>Max stacksize</i>. All other properties on this menu are explained
            <a href="base.html">here</a>. Note that, unlike most other custom items,
            it is not possible to choose a custom texture or model. This is because 
            the block item will automatically take on the texture and model of its 
            block.
        </p>
        <ul>
            <li>
                The <i>Block</i> is the custom block that will be placed when players 
                use this block item. The text on the button shows which custom block 
                is currently selected. Click the button to change it.
            </li>
            <li>
                The <i>Max stacksize</i> is the maximum stacksize of the block item 
                <b>in Survival mode</b>.
            </li>
        </ul>
