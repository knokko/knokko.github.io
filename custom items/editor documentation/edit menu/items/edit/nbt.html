        <p>
            The item nbt menu can be used to configure the NBT tags of custom 
            items. If you haven't done anything yet, it should look like this:
        </p>
        <img src="nbt.png" width="50%" />
        <h3>Basic buttons</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>
                The 'Cancel' button will take you back to the item edit menu you 
                came from, without keeping any changes you made to the NBT.
            </li>
            <li>
                The 'Apply' button will keep the changes you made to the item 
                NBT and then take you back to the item edit menu you came from.
            </li>
            <li>
                The 'Add integer' button will add a new empty key-value pair of
                type integer. After clicking this button, you should configure it
                by clicking the new buttons and changing the values in the new 
                edit fields.
            </li>
            <li>
                The 'Add string' button will add a new empty key-value pair of
                type string (text). After clicking this button, you should 
                configure it by clicking the new buttons and changing the values 
                in the new edit fields.
            </li>
            <li>
                Currently, only integer and string tags are supposed, but this 
                might change in the future.
            </li>
        </ul>
        <h3>Configuring entries</h3>
        <p>
            After you click on the 'Add integer' or 'Add string' button, the 
            following elements should appear:
        </p>
        <img src="nbt pair.png" width="100%" />
        <ul>
            <li>
                The edit field on the left is to define the <i>key</i> of the nbt 
                pair/entry. Initially, it will have only 1 part, but you can add 
                more parts by clicking on the green + button. See the example a 
                bit below to see how these parts work. <b>You can use the right arrow
                key to scroll sidewards if you have many parts.</b>
            </li>
            <li>
                The edit field on the right is to define the <i>value</i> of the nbt 
                pair/entry. Unlike the key, this can only have 1 part. If you clicked
                on the 'Add string' button, you can insert any string as value. If 
                you clicked on the 'Add integer' button, you can only insert integers
                as value.
            </li>
            <li>
                Clicking the red cross will remove its corresponding pair/entry.
            </li>
        </ul>
        <p>
            To understand how the parts work, consider the configuration in the 
            following image:
        </p>
        <img src="nbt example.png" width="100%" />
        <p>
            If you use this configuration, the item nbt would get the following 
            NBT: {<b>DummyTag: {hello: "creeper"}</b>, KnokkosCustomItems: {
                Name: "example_item", <i>some other internal nbt stuff</i>
            }}
        </p>
        <p>
            If you add multiple entries and these entries share their first part(s)
            then will share their parent tag(s).
        </p>
