            This menu can be used to modify a single glide velocity modifier of a custom elytra. It consists of several
            <i>requirements</i> and any number of <i>accelerations</i>. This menu should look like this:

        <h2>Requirements</h2>
        <p>
            The <i>requirements</i> determine in which circumstances the <i>accelerations</i> will be activated. If any of
            the requirements is not satisfied, the accelerations will <b>not</b> be activated. One way to use the requirements
            is to only activate the accelerations while the player is looking up, but there are many more ways in which
            they can be used.
        </p>
        <h3>Minimum and maximum pitch</h3>
        <p>
            The <i>pitch</i> is the angle at which the player is looking. A pitch of 90 degrees indicates that the player is
            looking straight to the sky and a pitch of -90 degrees indicates that the player is looking straight to the
            ground. A pitch of 0 degrees indicates that the player is looking at the horizon. The accelerations will only
            be activated while the pitch of the player is between the <i>Minimum pitch</i> and the <i>Maximum pitch</i>.
            The default values are -30 degrees and 30 degrees, which requires the players pitch to be between -30 degrees
            and 30 degrees. This is also required for vanilla elytra to function properly.
        </p>
        <h3>Minimum and maximum vertical velocity</h3>
        <p>
            The <i>vertical velocity</i> is the speed at which the player is falling/descending or climbing/ascending.
            It is given in meters/tick, where 1 meter per tick is basically 20 blocks per second (quite fast). A negative
            vertical velocity indicates that the player is descending/falling and a positive velocity indicates that the
            player is ascending/climbing. The accelerations will only be activated if the vertical velocity of the player
            is between <i>Minimum vertical velocity</i> and <i>Maximum vertical velocity</i>. The most straightforward
            usecase for this requirement is to activate the accelerations only when the player is ascending or only when
            the player is descending.
        </p>
        <h3>Minimum and maximum horizontal velocity</h3>
        <p>
            The <i>horizontal velocity</i> is the speed at which the player is moving forward. It is given in meters/tick,
            where 1 meter per tick is basically 20 blocks per second. Unlike the <i>vertical</i> velocity, the 
            <i>horizontal</i> velocity is never negative. The accelerations will only be activated if the horizontal
            velocity of the player is between the <i>Minimum horizontal velocity</i> and the 
            <i>Maximum horizontal velocity</i>. This requirement is especially useful for forward accelerations, to prevent
            the player from going too fast.
        </p>
        <h2>Accelerations</h2>
        <p>
            The accelerations will <i>accelerate</i> the player in some direction. For instance, it can increase or
            decrease the speed of the player. It could also be used to help the playing with ascending. Each acceleration
            will be executed once per tick (so 20 times per second) <b>if</b> all <i>requirements</i> are satisfied. Each
            acceleration has a <i>source axis</i>, a <i>target axis</i>, and a <i>factor</i> and each one is written
            down as <b>Increase <i>target axis</i> velocity by <i>factor</i> * <i>source axis</i> velocity</b>. 
        </p>
        <p>
            In the example shown in the screenshot, the <i>horizontal velocity</i> is increased by 0.5 * the 
            <i>vertical velocity</i>, which will happen 20 times per second. When the player is falling, this would
            dramatically slow the player down because the vertical velocity is negative while falling. When the player
            is climbing, this would instead speed the player up. Note that 0.5 is a pretty large value because
            <b>the accelerations are executed 20 times per second</b>.
