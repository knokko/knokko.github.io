        <p>
            The damage resistances edit menu can be used to configure the protection a piece of custom armor gives
            against invidividual damage causes. It should look like this:
        </p>
        <img src="damage resistances.png" width="50%" />
        <p>
            On the left are a 'Cancel' button and an 'Apply' button. Also, there is a 'Custom...'
            button that allows you to configure the resistances against
            <a href="../damage source/overview.html">custom damage sources</a>.
            The rest of the page is filled with edit fields for every damage cause at the time of writing this.
        </p>
        <ul>
            <li>
                The 'Cancel' button will take you back to the <a href="armor.html">armor edit menu</a> you came from,
                <b>without</b> keeping any changes you made in this menu.
            </li>
            <li>
                The 'Apply' button will also take you back to the <a href="armor.html">armor edit menu</a> you came from,
                but it will <b>keep</b> the changes you made in this menu.
            </li>
            <li>
                <p>
                    For every damage cause, there is an edit field on its right that allows you to configure the resistance 
                    against that particular damage cause (in percents). To demonstrate this, let's consider what happens if 
                    you change the resistance against falling damage (the edit field on the right of 'Fall:').
                </p>
                <ul>
                    <li>
                        If you keep it at 0%, players wearing this armor piece will get falling damage like normal.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        If you change it to 50%, players wearing this armor piece will get only half of the falling damage.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        If you change it to 90%, players wearing this armor piece will get only 10% of the falling damage.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        If you change it to 100%, players wearing this armor piece will become completely immune to falling damage.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        If you change it to 150%, players wearing this armor piece will <b>heal</b> upon taking falling damage 
                        for half of the damage they would have taken.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        If you change it to -100%, players wearing this armor piece will get twice as much falling damage.
                    </li>
                </ul>
                <p>
                    These were just examples, you can use any integer value you want, but it has to be between -10000% and
                    10200% (why would you ever want to exceed such values anyway?). When players have multiple pieces of custom 
                    armor with damage resistances equipped, the resistance percentages of the pieces will be summed up:
                    If both the boots and the chestplate give 50% resistance against 'Fall', the player will get 100% 
                    resistance and thus becomes completely immune to falling damage.
                    A few more things to note:
                </p>
                <ul>
                    <li>
                        If you want players who wear the custom armor piece to become immune to all fire damage, you 
                        should not only set the resistance to 'Fire' to 100%, but also those of 'Fire tick', 'Lava'
                        and 'Hot floor'.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        When the resistance against a damage source is 100% or higher, the player will no longer
                        become red, play hurt sounds or lose armor durability upon 'taking damage' from that damage source.
                        When players take damage normally, they can temporarily not take any other damage (roughly half a second),
                        so when players are swimming in lava, this causes the player to survive much longer because they only take 
                        damage once or twice per second instead of the 20 times per second if that short damage immunity wouldn't exist.
                        When the resistance against a damage cause is 100% or higher, that brief damage immunity will <b>not</b> be 
                        given.
                        So when the resistance against lava would be above 100%, the player will heal from it 20 times per second,
                        which will heal very fast.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        The /kill command uses the 'Void' damage source. 
                        So make sure not to let items reach the 100% resistance against 'Void' because that will make
                        them immune to the /kill command. (You can still kick or ban them, but it's quite inconvenient.)
                    </li>
                </ul>
            </li>
        </ul>
