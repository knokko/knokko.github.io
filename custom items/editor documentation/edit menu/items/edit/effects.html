            The potion effect overview is a menu where you can view and modify a list of potion effects.
            If you currently have a single potion effect with the heal effect type, a duration of 1 tick and level 1,
            it should look like this:
        </p>
        <img src="effects.png" width="50%" />
        <p>
            On the left are the 'Cancel', 'New Effect' and 'Apply' buttons.
            Additionally, there is a red cross, effect type button, duration edit field and level edit field 
            for each potion effect currently in the list.
        </p>
        <ul>
            <li>
                The 'Cancel' button will bring you back to the item edit menu you came from, <b>without</b>
                keeping any changes you made in this menu.
            </li>
            <li>
                The 'New Effect' button will add a new potion effect to the list and add its corresponding
                buttons and edit fields.
            </li>
            <li>
                The 'Apply' button will bring you back to the item edit menu you came from <b>and keep</b>
                all changes you made in this menu.
            </li>
            <li>
                The red cross on the left of every potion effect row will remove the corresponding potion effect 
                from the list as well as its corresponding buttons and edit fields.
            </li>
            <li>
                The effect type button (only the 'Heal' button in the screenshot above) allows you to change 
                the potion effect type of its corresponding potion effect. The text on the button is the 
                currently chosen potion effect type (or the default one if you haven't changed it yet).
                Clicking it will bring you to menu where you can either click on 'Cancel' or on a potion 
                effect type. Clicking on 'Cancel' will bring you back to this potion effect overview without 
                changing the potion effect type. Clicking on any potion effect type will change the potion effect 
                type of the corresponding potion effect to the type whose button you clicked. Note that this menu 
                uses the Bukkit potion effect type names rather than the minecraft names you are probably used to.
                This is because it's easier to work with for this plugin (and other plugins).
            </li>
            <li>
                The Duration edit field allows you to change the duration of its corresponding option effect 
                <b>in seconds</b>. The duration must be a positive integer.
            </li>
            <li>
                The Level edit field allows you to change the level of its corresponding potion effect.
                The level must be a positive integer.
            </li>
        </ul>
