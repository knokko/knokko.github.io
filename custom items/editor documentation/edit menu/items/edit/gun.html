        <p>
            The gun edit menu can be used to create and modify gun custom items.
            These are custom items that fire custom projectiles and consume ammo
            by doing so (unlike wands, which don't use ammo). When you just
            started creating a new gun, the menu should look like this:
        </p>
        <img src="gun.png" width="50%" />
        <p>
            The properties on the right (<i>Projectile</i>, <i>Ammo system</i>, and 
            <i>Amount per shot</i> are unique to guns. These will be explained below. 
            All other properties in this menu are explained <a href="base.html">here</a>.
        </p>
        <h3>Projectile</h3>
        <p>
            The custom projectile that will be fired by this gun. The button on the 
            right of <i>Projectile:</i> will display the name of the currently 
            selected projectile (or <i>None</i> if you haven't selected one yet).
            Click the button to change it. 
            <b>
                Note: you need to create the custom projectile before you can 
                create a gun that shoots it.
            </b>
            To create a custom projectile, go back to the 
            <a href="../../index.html">edit menu</a> and click <i>Projectiles</i>...
        </p>
        <h3>Ammo system</h3>
        <p>
            The ammo system determines how the gun will consume ammo items upon
            shooting and whether it needs to be loaded first. Click the 
            <i>Change...</i> button on the right of <i>Ammo system:</i> to 
            configure it. That would take you to the 
            <a href="gun ammo.html">gun ammo menu</a>. (See the documentation on 
            that page for more information.)
        </p>
        <h3>Amount per shot</h3>
        <p>
            The <i>Amount per shot</i> determines how many projectiles will be
            fired each time a player uses this gun. If you choose a value larger
            than 1, multiple copies of the same projectile will be fired.
            <b>Note: using a value larger than 1 will <i>not</i> increase the 
            ammo usage; If you want it to consume more ammo, change the 
            <i>Ammo system</i>.</b>
        </p>
        <h3>Requires permission</h3>
        <p>
            Whether players need a permission to shoot projectiles with this gun. If this is unchecked, any player
            can shoot projectiles with this gun. If this is checked, only players with the <b>customitems.shoot.GUN_NAME</b>
            or the <b>customitems.shootall</b> permission can shoot projectiles with this gun.
