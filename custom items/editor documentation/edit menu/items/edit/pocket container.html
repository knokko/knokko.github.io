    <p>
        This menu can be used to create or edit pocket containers. Pocket containers 
        are custom items that can open
        <a href="../../containers/edit.html">custom containers</a> when a player 
        right-clicks with the item in their hand. This menu should look like this:
    </p>
    <img src="pocket container.png" width="50%" />
    <p>
        Most stuff in this menu is described <a href="./base.html">here</a>. 
        The <i>Containers</i> are the only properties that are specific to pocket 
        containers. Clicking the <i>Choose...</i> button will take you to the 
        <a href="pocket container selection.html">pocket container selection</a>,
        where you can choose which containers can be opened with this item.
