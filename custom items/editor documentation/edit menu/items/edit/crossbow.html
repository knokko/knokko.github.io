        <p>
            The crossbow edit menu can be used to edit or create custom crossbows.
            If you just started creating a new custom crossbow, it should look
            like this:
        </p>
        <img src="crossbow.png" width="50%" />
        <p>
            This menu has almost everything the <a href="tool.html">tool edit menu</a> has, but more.
            Contrary to the tool edit menu, this menu does <b>not</b> allow a custom model.
            That feature was left out because crossbows have completely different models and didn't 
            seem very relevant (I think almost nobody would use it).
            Also, custom crossbows need Crossbow textures instead of normal textures.
            <b>Make sure you have loaded the crossbow texture into the editor before you start 
            filling in the other properties of the custom crossbow.</b>
            For more information about crossbow textures, see the 
            <a href="../../textures/crossbow edit.html">crossbow texture edit menu</a>.
            You can reach it from the <a href="../../textures/overview.html">texture overview</a>.

        <h3>Durability loss on shooting arrows</h3>
        <p>
            This is the amount of durability that the crossbow will lose after
            shooting an arrow. This will be ignored if the crossbow is unbreakable.
        </p>
        <h3>Durability loss on shooting firework</h3>
        <p>
            This is the amount of durability that the crossbow will lose after 
            shooting a firework rocket (players can do this when holding a crossbow 
            in their main hand and a firework rocket in their offhand). This will be 
            ignored if the crossbow is unbreakable.
        </p>
        <h3>Arrow damage multiplier</h3>
        <p>
            When someone is hit by an arrow fired from this custom crossbow, the 
            damage will be multiplied by this number. For instance, setting this 
            number to 2 will cause the custom crossbow to deal twice the damage of 
            a regular crossbow when shooting arrows.
        </p>
        <h3>Firework damage multiplier</h3>
        <p>
            When someone is hit by a firework rocket fired from this custom 
            crossbow, the damage will be multiplied by this number. For instance,
            setting this number to 2 will cause the custom crossbow to deal twice 
            the damage of a regular crossbow when shooting firework rockets.
        </p>
        <h3>Arrow speed multiplier</h3>
        <p>
            When an arrow is shot from this custom crossbow, its speed will be
            multiplied by this number. For instance, setting this number to 2 will 
            cause arrows fired by this custom crossbow to fly twice as fast as 
            arrows fired from a regular crossbow. Note that faster arrows deal more 
            damage than slower arrows, so increasing this number will also increase
            the damage.
        </p>
        <h3>Firework speed multiplier</h3>
        <p>
            When a firework rocket is shot from this custom crossbow, its speed
            will be multiplied by this number. For instance, setting this number to 
            2 will cause firework rockets fired by this custom crossbow to fly 
            twice as fast as firework rockets fired from regular crossbows.
            Unlike arrows, firework rockets won't deal more damage when they have 
            more speed.
        </p>
        <h3>Arrow knockback strength</h3>
        <p>
            When someone gets hit by an arrow fired from this custom crossbow,
            this amount will affect the knockback given to the victim. If this 
            amount is 1, the victim will get the same knockback as if he were
            struck by a regular crossbow with the enchantment Punch 1. If the 
            custom crossbow is enchanted with Punch, the <i>effective</i>
            punch will be the sum of the Punch enchantment level and this amount.
            For instance, if the custom crossbow is enchanted with Punch 1 and
            has an arrow knockback strength of 2, the victim will get the same 
            knockback as if he were struck by a regular crossbow with Punch 
            level 3.
        </p>
        <h3>Arrow gravity</h3>
        <p>
            Whether arrows fired from this custom crossbow will be affected by 
            gravity. If this checkbox is checked, the arrows will be affected by 
            gravity and thus fall down. If this checkbox is not checked, the arrows 
            will ignore gravity and fly in a straight line.
