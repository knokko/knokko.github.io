        <p>
            The 3d helmet edit menu can be used to create or modify 3d helmet custom 
            items. These are like regular custom helmets, but they can show a custom 
            3d model when worn. This is unfortunately the only armor piece that can 
            have such a custom model (without Optifine). If you just started creating 
            a new one, it should look like this:
        </p>
        <img src="helmet3d.png" width="50%" />
        <p>
            3d helmets don't have any properties regular armor pieces don't have, so 
            you can find information about all these properties in the 
            <a href="armor.html">armor edit menu</a>. But, there are a couple of
            differences:
        </p>
        <ul>
            <li>
                3d helmets <b>must</b> have a custom model (otherwise they don't 
                really make sense). An example model will be shown at the bottom
                of this page.
            </li>
            <li>
                3d helmets never have a leather color (because that would be useless
                since you can define the entire model anyway).
            </li>
            <li>
                The internal item type must be a hoe rather than a helmet. This is 
                because of the resourcepack rules of minecraft: all items can show a 
                custom model when being worn in the helmet slot, <b>except
                helmets.</b> (I didn't write this rule, but we will have to deal with 
                it.) The plug-in will ensure that the 3d helmets can still be equipped
                like regular helmets, so you shouldn't notice anything about this 
                in-game.
            </li>
        </ul>
        <p>
            As promised, below is an example of a custom model:
        </p>
        <p>
            {
                "parent": "block/orientable",
                "textures": {
                    "top": "blocks/furnace_top",
                    "front": "customitems/<b>NAME_OF_ONE_OF_YOUR_TEXTURES</b>",
                    "side": "blocks/furnace_side"
                }
            }
        </p>
        <p>
            Make sure you replace the <b>NAME_OF_ONE_OF_YOUR_TEXTURES</b> with the 
            name of one of your textures (doesn't have to be 'the texture' of the 
            helmet you're editing.) This is a silly example model that will make 
            the helmet a furnace, but with a different front texture.
        </p>
        <p>
            This model is obviously not great, but a nice example. You should use a 
            custom elements section in the model to create a nicer model.
        </p>
