        <p>
            The worn armor texture menu can be used to change the texture of the 
            armor when the player equips it (the texture on top of the player skin,
            <b>not</b> the regular icon texture). In this menu, you can pick an
            existing armor texture, or create a new one. If you have made 2 worn
            armor textures so far (named "hell1" and "hell2"), it should look 
            like this:
        </p>
        <img src="worn texture.png" width="50%" />
        <ul>
            <li>
                There will be a pink button for each worn armor texture you have 
                made so far. Clicking any of them will select the corresponding
                worn armor and take you back to the armor edit menu.
            </li>
            <li>
                Clicking the 'Cancel' button will take you back to the armor edit 
                menu, without selecting a new worn armor texture.
            </li>
            <li>
                Clicking the 'Create new' button will take you to the 
                <a href="../../textures/armor edit.html">armor texture edit menu</a>, 
                where you can create a new armor texture.
            </li>
        </ul>
