            As the name suggests, this menu can be used to choose a custom model for a custom item. Custom models are encoded in
            JSON files. The Editor does <b>not</b> have built-in functionality to create custom models. Instead, you need to either
            use a third-party tool like Blockbench to generate them, or write them by hand (only do this if you know what you're doing).
            When you just opened this menu, it should look like this:
        </p>
        <img src="custom initial.png" width="50%" />
        <p>
            First, you should click the <b>Choose file...</b> button and select the JSON file of your model. Once you have done that,
            this menu should look like this:
        </p>
        <img src="custom selected.png" width="50%" />
        <p>
            Almost all custom models in minecraft need at least 1 texture. The Editor will read the model and determine which textures
            it needs. For each texture, it creates an entry below the <b>Choose file</b> button. In this example, the custom model
            needs 6 textures: <i>handle</i> and <i>pointer</i>1 until 5. Every model needs different textures, so you will probably
            see something else. You need to click on the <b>Edit</b> button of each texture entry and select the corresponding texture. 
            Once you have done that, an <b>Apply</b> button should appear, and you should click that.
