            The item model edit menu can be used to view and edit the model of a custom item. Item models are a minecraft resource
            pack feature that makes it possible to customize the appearance of an item more than just changing its texture. This menu
            should look like this:
        </p>
        <img src="index.png" width="50%" />
        <p>
            The current model of the custom item is shown on the left. If you haven't chosen a custom model (yet), this will show the
            default item model that this plug-in is going to use. (Except when you are viewing a custom 3d helmet, which is not allowed
            to have a default model.) You can use the buttons on the right to change the model of the custom item.
        </p>
        <ul>
            <li>
                The <b>Default model</b> button will take you to the <a href="default.html">choose default model menu</a>, where you can
                change the current item model to a default model. <b>Note: this option is not available for 3d custom helmets.</b>
            </li>
            <li>
                The <b>Custom model</b> button will take you to the <a href="custom.html">choose custom model menu</a>, where you can
                change the current item model to a custom model.
            </li>
        </ul>
    </body>
