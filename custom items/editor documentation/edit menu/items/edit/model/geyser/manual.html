    <p>
        The manual Geyser model selection menu can be used to select a Bedrock edition item model for your custom item.
        It should look like this:
    </p>
    <img src="manual.png" width="50%" />
    <p>
        To complete a Bedrock edition model, you need to supply 4 files:
    </p>
    <ul>
        <li>The animation file, which goes to the animations/minecraft/customitems directory</li>
        <li>The attachable file, which goes to the attachables/minecraft/customitems directory</li>
        <li>The model file, which goes to the models/blocks/minecraft/customitems directory</li>
        <li>The texture, which goes to the textures directory</li>
    </ul>
</body>
