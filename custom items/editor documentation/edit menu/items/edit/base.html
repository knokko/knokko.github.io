            This page describes the shared properties of all custom item types.
            Every custom item that can be made will have the properties that are explained here.
            Contrary to most other pages in the documentation, there is no direct menu for this page itself.
            The image below shows how this menu would probably look like if it would exist:
        </p>

        <h2>Buttons</h2>
        <p>
            This 'menu' contains a 'Cancel' button and an 'Apply' or 'Create' button.
            When creating a new item, it will be a 'Create' button.
            When editing an existing item, it will be an 'Apply' button.
        </p>
        <h3>Cancel</h3>
        <p>
            Clicking the 'Cancel' button when creating a new custom item will bring you back to the 
            <a href="../overview.html">item overview</a> <b>without</b> adding the item in progress.
            Clicking the 'Cancel' button when editing an existing custom item will discard all changes
            made to that item and bring you back to the <a href="../overview.html">item overview</a>.
        </p>
        <h3>Apply/Create</h3>
        <p>
            Clicking the 'Apply' button will run a lot of validation checks to make sure everything is 
            ok. If so, it will apply all changes made and then bring you back to the <a href="../overview.html">item overview</a>.
            Clicking the 'Create' button will run similar validation checks. If everything is alright,
            the new custom item will be added to the item set and you will then be brought back to the
            <a href="../overview.html">item overview</a>.
        </p>
        <h2>Properties</h2>
        <p>
            The rest of the buttons and labels on this menu is dedicated to the properties of the custom item 
            that is being modified. Although there are a lot of properties, the only two properties that you 
            have to choose when creating a new item are the Name and Texture: all other properties are either 
            not required or will have a valid default value.
        </p>
        <h3>Name</h3>
        <p>
            The unique name of the custom item: no two custom items in the same item set can have the same name.
            The name will be used as filenames in the resourcepacks the editor will generate and the name can be
            used in the <b>/customitems give</b> command. Note that the name of the custom item is <b>not</b> its
            display name: there is another field for that. Players will normally not see the names of custom items
            (unless they open up the server resourcepack with some archive manager). Currently, the rules for valid 
            names are very strict: only characters in the alphabet, numbers, and underscores are allowed.
        </p>
        <p>
            Because of internal reasons, renaming items is impossible once they have 
            been created. Also, once an item has been deleted, no new item with its 
            name can be created.
        </p>
        <h3>Internal item type</h3>
        <p>
            The vanilla item type of the custom item that will be used in the plug-in.
            The button on the right of 'Internal item type:' will display the currently chosen item type.
            Clicking on that button will allow you to choose another one, but which ones you can choose depends
            on the custom item type of the item you are editing/creating.
            For instance, simple custom items can choose between hoes and shears while custom bows have no choise
            but to use a bow. Most of the properties of the custom item can be overruled with for instance attribute
            modifiers, but the following properties are still determined by the internal item type:
            <ul>
                <li>The mining speed (important for pickaxes mostly)</li>
                <li>The enchantability (only for tools)</li>
                <li>The texture when players don't use the resoucepack</li>
            </ul>
            The internal item type will <b>not</b> affect the following properties:
            <ul>
                <li>The attack damage of the item (can be done with attribute modifiers)</li>
                <li>The maximum durability of the item (can be done with 'Max uses')</li>
            </ul>
            <b>
                Note: due to technical reasons, there is a limit on the number of 
                custom items that can have the same internal item type. This limit 
                is the maximum durability of that item in minecraft
                (for instance ~60 for wooden tools and 1000+ for diamond tools).
                If you use diamond tools, it will take a lot of time to reach this 
                limit, but you might hit this limit when using golden tools.
                There is an exception to this rule: 2 or more items with the same
                item type and texture only count as 1 if neither of them has a 
                custom model.
            </b>
        </p>
        <h3>Alias</h3>
        <p>
            The 'alias' of the custom item. The alias can be used instead of the 
            name of the item when using the <b>/kci give</b> command. For instance,
            if you have a custom item with name <i>ruby</i> and alias <i>r</i>,
            you can use <i>/kci give ruby</i> <b>or</b> <i>/kci give r</i> to give 
            the item to yourself in-game. If you leave the alias field blank, the 
            item won't have an alias, and you can give it only by specifying its 
            full name.
        </p>
        <h3>Display name</h3>
        <p>
            The display name of the custom item.
            Unlike the name of the custom item, the display name is actually shown to players in-game and
            has almost no naming restrictions: it is allowed to have basically any character you can get inserted
            into its edit field. You can use the &-character for color codes; they will automatically be replaced
            with the real color character that is somewhat annoying to insert.
            You can use <a href="https://codepen.io/0biwan/pen/ggVemP">this site</a>
            to generate color codes for you. Then, you can paste them using
            control V.
        </p>
        <h3>Lore</h3>
        <p>
            The item lore that will be given to the custom item in-game. 
            Clicking on the 'Change...' button on the right of the 'Lore:' will bring you to a 
            <a href="../../text list.html">text list edit menu</a> where you will be able to type the lines of lore.
            You can use color codes in lines of lore. To do so, you need to type either the '&'-character or the
            real color code character. Upon clicking on 'Apply', any & will be replaced by the color character.
        </p>
        <h3>Attribute modifiers</h3>
        <p>
            Attribute modifiers are the right way to configure the attack damage of custom swords and the
            armor of custom armor pieces. They can also be used for a lot of other stuff.
            For those who are already familiar with attribute modifiers, this should be quite straightforward.
            For those who aren't, attribute modifiers can be used to change attack damage, attack speed, movement speed,
            max health and some other attributes of players when they have a certain item equipped in the right slot (for instance
            main hand or helmet).
        </p>
        <p>
            To change the attribute modifiers this custom item will get in-game, click on the 'Change...' button on the right
            of 'Attribute modifiers:'. That should bring you to the <a href="attributes.html">attribute modifier edit menu</a>.
        </p>
        <h3>Default enchantments</h3>
        <p>
            Default enchantments are the enchantments custom items will automatically get whenever they are created (or dropped).
            Note that giving any default enchantments to custom items will prevent them from being enchanted in an enchanting
            table because it's not possible to enchant items that are already enchanted.
            To change the default enchantments of the custom item, click on the 'Change...' button on the right of 'Default enchantments:'.
            Doing that should bring you to the <a href="enchantments.html">default enchantment edit menu</a> where you can change them.
        </p>
        <h3>Item flags</h3>
        <p>
            Item flags can be used to hide some properties of (custom) items like attributes or enchantments.
            To change the item flags of custom items in-game, click on the 'Change...' button on the right of 'Item flags:'.
            That will bring you to the <a href="flags.html">item flag selection menu</a> where you can choose which item flags 
            you wan't and don't wan't.
        </p>
        <h3>Texture</h3>
        <p>
            The texture is probably the reason you are using this plug-in. 
            It allows you to select the image of the custom item in-game. 
            To select (or change) the texture, click on the button on the right of 'Texture:',
            which will bring you to the <a href="texture.html">texture selection menu</a> where you can select a texture you loaded.
        </p>
        <h3>Model</h3>
        <p>
            The model allows you to assign a custom item model file to the custom item.
            This is a somewhat advanced resourcepack feature of minecraft, but those
            who are already familiar with creating resourcepacks will probably know what they are.
            For those who do not know what they are, it's probably better to ignore this.
            Clicking on the 'Change...' button on the right of 'Model:' will bring you to the 
            <a href="model.html">model edit menu</a> where you can choose a model.
        </p>
        <h3>On-hit player/target effects</h3>
        <p>
            Whenever someone (the target) is being hit with a custom item, all on-hit target (potion) effects of
            the custom item will be given to the target. Also, all on-hit player (potion) effects will be given
            to the one who hit the target. I called it on-hit player effects because the attacker will usually
            be a player, but note that it will work just as well when a monster is using a custom item as weapon.
            To change the on-hit player effects or on-hit target effects, click on the corresponding 'Change...' button,
            which should bring you to the right <a href="chance effects.html">chance potion effect overview</a>.
        </p>
        <h3>Commands</h3>
        <p>
            The 'commands' of a custom item are the commands that will be executed whenever certain events happen in-game (for 
            instance right-clicking or attacking mobs). Clicking the 'Change...' button will take you to the
            <a href="command/events.html">command event list</a>, where you can configure these commands.
        </p>
        <h3>Replace on right-click</h3>
        <p>
            The conditions for which an item is replaced with another item on a right-click. Currently an item can only be replaced by another
            custom item. Clicking the 'Change...' button will take you to the <a href="replace.html">Replace on right-click menu</a>, where you will
            be able to specify the conditions.
        </p>
        <h3>Held/equipped potion effects</h3>
        <p>
            The potion effects that should be granted to players (or other entities)
            as long as they are holding the custom item in the right slot. Clicking 
            the 'Change...' button will take you to the 
            <a href="equipped effects.html">Equipped effects menu</a>, where you will 
            be able to choose the effects.
        </p>
        <h3>NBT</h3>
        <p>
            Custom item stacks will always carry some NBT tags (so that the plugin
            can recognize it). If you want, you can add additional NBT tags to such
            item stacks (can be useful to cooperate with other plug-ins). Clicking 
            the 'Change...' button to go to the <a href="nbt.html">item nbt menu</a>
            where you can configure this.
        </p>
        <h3>Attack range multiplier</h3>
        <p>
            The attack range multiplier determines from how far players can do 
            basic attacks when having the custom item in their main hand. If you 
            give the value 2.0, players will be able to hit people from twice
            the normal distance. If you give the value 0.5, players will have to
            get twice as close as usual before they can hit someone. When you
            leave the value at 1, the attack range of players will stay the same.
            For reference, the <b>default</b> attack ranges of players are 
            shown below:
            <ul>
                <li>3 blocks distance in survival (and adventure) mode</li>
                <li>
                    4 blocks distance in creative when playing minecraft 1.12 
                    or earlier
                </li>
                <li>
                    5 blocks distance in creative when playing minecraft 1.13
                    or later
                </li>
            </ul>
            To get back at the example, when you give the value 2.0 and a player 
            holds the custom item in survival mode, he will be able to hit other 
            players and monsters from 6 blocks distance rather than the regular
            3 blocks distance.
        </p>
