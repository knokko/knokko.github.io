        <p>
            The multi block break menu can be used to configure the <i>multi block break</i> feature of a custom item. This feature
            makes it possible to destroy surrounding blocks whenever a player destroys a block using this custom item. (For instance
            destroying all blocks that are adjacent to the broken block.) This menu should look like this:

        <h3>Shape and Size</h3>
        <p>
            The <i>shape</i> and <i>size</i> of the surrounding area in which the blocks will be broken. There are currently 2
            possible shapes:
        </p>
        <ul>
            <li>
                Cube: the original broken block is considered as the center of a <b>cube</b>. All blocks within this <b>cube</b>
                will be broken.
                <ul>
                    <li>When <i>size</i> = 1, only the original block will be broken.</li>
                    <li>When <i>size</i> = 2, a 3x3x3 cube will be excavated.</li>
                    <li>When <i>size</i> = 3, a 5x5x5 cube will be excavated.</li>
                    <li>When <i>size</i> = 4, a 7x7x7 cube will be excavated...</li>
                </ul>
            </li>
            <li>
                Manhattan: breaks all blocks whose <i>Manhattan distance</i> to the original broken block is smaller than the 
                <i>size</i> (specified by you). The Manhattan distance is (distance on x-axis) + (distance on y-axis)
                + (distance on z-axis).
                <ul>
                    <li>When <i>size</i> = 1, only the original block will be broken.</li>
                    <li>When <i>size</i> = 2, all adjacent blocks will be broken as well.</li>
                    <li>When <i>size</i> = 3, all blocks that are adjacent to the adjacent blocks will be broken as well.</li>
                    <li>When <i>size</i> = 4, all blocks that are adjacent to those blocks will be broken as well...</li>
                </ul>
            </li>
        </ul>
        <h3>Stack durability cost</h3>
        <p>
            This is only applicable to breakable custom tools. Consider the case when using the <i>cube shape</i> and <i>size</i> = 2.
            (So breaking a single block with this custom tool will cause up to 3x3x3 = 27 blocks to be broken.) When you keep this
            checked/enabled, this will cause the custom tool to loose up to 27 as much durability. When you uncheck/disable this, the 
            custom tool will always loose the same amount of durability, no matter how many blocks are broken.
        </p>
        <b>
            Note: to prevent abuse, only surrounding blocks of the <i>same type</i> as the original block can be broken. For instance,
            placing a dirt block adjacent to obsidian and then destroying that dirt block will <b>not</b> destroy the obsidian.
        </b>
