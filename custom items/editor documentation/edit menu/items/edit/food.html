            The food edit menu can be used to create custom food or custom drinks.
            These custom items can be eaten (or drunk) by players and can restore
            hunger and/or give potion effects to these players. If you just started
            creating new custom food, it should look like this:

        <p>
            All properties on the left of this page are explained
            <a href="base.html">here</a>. The properties on the right of this page
            are unique to custom food (and drinks) and are explained below:
        </p>
        <h3>Food value</h3>
        <p>
            The food value determines how much 'hunger' will be recovered when 
            eating this custom food. Every point stands for a half 'meat' icon
            in the hunger bar of the player. For instance, if you keep the 
            value 5, players who eat it will recover 2 and half 'meat' icon in 
            their hunger bar (which is 25% of their hunger bar). If you choose
            20, players will restore their entire hunger bar upon eating the 
            custom food. If you choose a negative value, players will get
            more hungry rather than less hungry upon eating this custom food.
        </p>
        <h3>Eat effects</h3>
        <p>
            The eat effects are the potion effects that will be given to players 
            who eat this custom food (or your custom drink). You are allowed to
            keep this list of potion effects empty.
        </p>
        <h3>Eat time</h3>
        <p>
            The <i>eat time</i> is the time (in ticks) that players need to eat 
            (or drink) this custom food. Just like regular food, players will 
            need to keep holding their right mouse button while eating, or the 
            eating will be cancelled. Unfortunately, the tracking of right-clicks
            is imprecise (so it is possible that players will finish the eating if 
            they release their mouse button when they nearly finish eating it).
        </p>
        <h3>Eat sound</h3>
        <p>
            The <i>eat sound</i> will be played while players are eating this custom 
            food. By default, this is <i>Entity generic eat</i>, which is the same
            sound that is played while eating vanilla food. If you want to make a 
            custom drink instead, you should change it to <i>Entity generic drink</i>. 
            You are free to choose other sounds as well.
        </p>
        <h3>Sound period</h3>
        <p>
            The <i>sound period</i> determines how often the <i>eat sound</i> will 
            be played. It will be played every <i>sound period</i> ticks while 
            players are eating this custom food. For instance, if you keep this 
            value 4, the <i>eat sound</i> will be played 5 times per second.
        </p>
        <h3>Max stacksize</h3>
        <p>
            The <i>max stacksize</i> determines the maximum stacksize of item stacks 
            of this custom food <b>in the <i>survival</i> gamemode</b>. It must be
            an integer between 1 and 64. The stacksize will be decreased by 1 each 
            time the player finishes eating this custom food.
