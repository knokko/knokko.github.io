            The pocket container selection lets you select which custom containers 
            can be opened from a pocket container. If you have 2 custom containers 
            with the names <i>pulverizer</i> and <i>smithing station</i>, it should 
            look like this:
        </p>
        <img src="pocket container selection.png" width="50%" />
        <ul>
            <li>
                Clicking <i>Cancel</i> will take you back to the 
                <a href="pocket container.html">pocket container edit menu</a>
                without keeping the changes you made in this menu.
            </li>
            <li>
                Clicking <i>Apply</i> will take you back to the 
                <a href="pocket container.html">pocket container edit menu</a>
                and keep all the changes you made here.
            </li>
        </ul>
        <p>
            All custom containers that are currently selected are green and 
            all custom containers that are currently not selected are gray.
            Clicking an unselected container will select it and clicking a
            selected container will deselect it. When a player right-clicks 
            with this pocket container, he will be able to choose from any 
            of the selected (green) containers. If only 1 container is selected,
            the player will open that container right away.
