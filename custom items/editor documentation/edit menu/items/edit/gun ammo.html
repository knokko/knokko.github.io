        <p>
            The gum ammo menu can be used to configure the ammo system of a gun.
            The ammo system determines what ammo a gun needs, how much ammo it needs,
            how quickly the gun can shoot, and a few more things. Currently, the 
            ammo system can be either <i>direct</i> or <i>indirect</i>.
        </p>
        <ul>
            <li>
                A gun with a <i>direct</i> ammo system will consume an ammo item from 
                the inventory each time it is shot. (This is similar to a bow: each 
                time it is shot, an arrow is consumed from the inventory.)
            </li>
            <li>
                A gun with an <i>indirect</i> ammo system will store its ammo inside 
                the gun. Each time the gun is shot, it will consume a bullet from 
                inside the gun. When an <i>indirect</i> gun runs out of internal ammo, 
                it must be reloaded. Reloading a gun will take some time (you can choose
                how long it takes) and will consume a recharge item from the inventory
                (optional).
            </li>
        </ul>
        <p>
            First, you need to choose whether you want a <i>direct</i> or <i>indirect</i>
            ammo system. To do so, click on the <i>Direct</i> or <i>Indirect</i> button 
            below <i>Type:</i>. Depending on this choice, different buttons and edit 
            fields will appear on the right.
        </p>
        <ul>
            <li>
                <p>
                    If you choose <i>Direct</i>, the menu should look like this:
                </p>
                <img src="gun ammo direct.png" width="50%" />
                <ul>
                    <li>
                        The <i>Ammo item</i> is the item that will be consumed 
                        from the inventory each time the gun is shot (and players
                        won't be able to shoot with the gun if they don't have
                        that item).
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        The <i>Cooldown</i> is the time (in ticks) that the player 
                        must wait after shooting with the gun before he can shoot with 
                        the gun again (or with any other gun in the same hand). If the 
                        value is 10, players will be able to shoot twice per second.
                        <b>
                            Unlike wand cooldowns, gun cooldowns are expected to be
                            short and will <i>not</i> be kept after a server restart.
                        </b>
                    </li>
                </ul>
            </li>
            <li>
                <p>
                    If you choose <i>Indirect</i>, the menu should look like this:
                </p>
                <img src="gun ammo indirect.png" width="50%" />
                <ul>
                    <li>
                        The recharge item is the item that will be consumed upon
                        reloading the gun (and must be in the player inventory in 
                        order to be able to reload the gun). This is <i>Optional</i>:
                        you can choose <i>Empty</i> if you don't want reloading to 
                        consume any item. (Keeping it empty is like the game
                        Overwatch: players must reload their gun when they run out of 
                        internal ammo, but reloading costs nothing except time.)
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        The <i>Cooldown</i> is the time (in ticks) that the player 
                        must wait after shooting with the gun before he can shoot with 
                        the gun again (or with any other gun in the same hand). If the 
                        value is 10, players will be able to shoot twice per second.

                        The <i>Stored ammo</i> is the number of bullets that will be 
                        stored <i>inside</i> the gun after reloading. Each time a 
                        player shoots with the gun, this amount will be decreased by 
                        1. When this amount reaches 0, the player must reload the 
                        gun before he can shoot again. If this amount is 1, the gun 
                        will act similarly to a crossbow: you must reload it after 
                        every shot. <b>
                            Note: this does <i>not</i> affect the number of items 
                            that will be consumed from the inventory when the gun 
                            is reloaded; only the <i>Recharge item</i> determines 
                            that (note that you can choose an <i>Amount</i> there).
                        </b>

                    <li>
                        The <i>Reload time</i> is the time (in ticks) that is needed
                        to reload the gun. Players can start reloading a gun by
                        right-clicking with it when it is out of internal ammo and
                        can't shoot any gun with the same hand until the reloading 
                        is complete.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        The <i>Start reload sound</i> will be played when a player 
                        starts reloading the gun. This is <i>optional</i>, so you 
                        can leave it <i>None</i> if you don't want it.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        The <i>Finish reload sound</i> will be played when a player 
                        finishes reloading the gun. Just like the <i>Start reload sound</i>,
                        this is completely optional.
                    </li>
                </ul>
