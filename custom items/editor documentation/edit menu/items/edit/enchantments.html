        <p>
            The default enchantments edit menu can be used to configure the default enchantments of a custom item.
            If the item has a single default unbreaking enchantment of level 2, it should look like this:
        </p>
        <img src="enchantments.png" width="50%" />
        <p>
            On the left are the 'Cancel', 'New Enchantment' and 'Apply' button.
            <ul>
                <li>
                    The 'Cancel' button will bring you back to the item edit menu you came from <b>without</b> keeping the 
                    changes you made in this menu.
                </li>
                <li>
                    The 'Apply' button will bring you back to the item edit menu you came from <b>while</b> keeping the 
                    changes you made in this menu.
                </li>
                <li>
                    The 'New Enchantment' button will add a new enchantment row (like the unbreaking 2 row).
                </li>
            </ul>
        </p>
        <p>
            Additionally, there is a red cross, enchantment button ('Unbreaking' in the screenshot above) and an edit field 
            for the enchantment level ('2' in the screenshot above).
            <ul>
                <li>The red cross will remove its corresponding enchantment row.</li>
                <li>
                    The enchantment button allows you to change the enchantment of the row.
                    Clicking it will bring you to a simple menu where you can either click 'Cancel' to keep the 
                    original enchantment or click on another button to change the enchantment of the row to the 
                    enchantment on the button. Note:
                    <ul>
                        <li>You need to scroll with your mouse wheel or arrow keys in order to see some enchantments.</li>
                        <li>
                            Some enchantments have a "[CRAZY]" suffix behind their name. These enchantments are only available if the 
                            <a href="https://www.spigotmc.org/resources/crazy-enchantments.16470/">Crazy Enchantments</a> plug-in
                            is installed.
                        </li>
                    </ul>
                </li>
                <li>
                    The edit field allows you to change the level of the enchantment.
                    You must type a positive integer in there, which will be the level of the enchantment in-game.
                    You can ignore almost all enchanting restrictions of minecraft, so you can just give sharpness
                    15 or protection 10. Also, you can use sharpness and smite on the same item.
                </li>
            </ul>
