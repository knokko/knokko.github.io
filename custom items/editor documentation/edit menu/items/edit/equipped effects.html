        <p>
            The equipped effects menu can be used to choose which potion effects 
            players (or other entities) should get while holding or equipping 
            a custom item in the right slot. If you just opened this menu and 
            clicked once on the 'Add new' button, it should look like this:
        </p>
        <img src="equipped effects.png" width="50%" />
        <ul>
            <li>
                Clicking the 'Cancel' button will take you back to the item edit menu 
                you came from, <b>without</b> keeping any changes you made here.
            </li>
            <li>
                Clicking the 'Apply' button will keep the changes you made and then
                take you back to the item edit menu you came from.
            </li>
            <li>
                Clicking the 'Add new' button will add a new potion effect row, which 
                you can thereafter adjust to your needs.
            </li>
        </ul>
        
        <p>
            Furthermore, there is a row for each potion effect currently present.
            Each row has the following buttons and fields:
        </p>
        <ul>
            <li>
                The red cross on the left will remove the row (and its associated
                potion effect).
            </li>
            <li>
                The <i>effect</i> button displays the currently selected potion 
                effect of the row. Click it to change it.
            </li>
            <li>
                The <i>slot</i> button displays the currently selected slot for 
                the potion effect. The potion effect will only be given if the 
                custom item is held or equipped in that slot. Click this button 
                to change the slot.
            </li>
            <li>
                The edit field on the right of 'Level:' displays the level of the 
                potion effect. Increasing the level will amplify the power of the 
                potion effect.
            </li>
        </ul>
