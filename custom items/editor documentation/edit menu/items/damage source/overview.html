            The custom damage source overview shows a list of all <i>custom damage sources</i>. You can create
            custom armor that is strong or weak against specific <i>custom damage sources</i>, and you can
            configure custom items to deal such <i>custom damage</i>. If you have <i>shock</i> and <i>frost</i>
            custom damage sources, it should look like this:

        <h3>Example usage</h3>
        With these custom damage sources, you could:
        <ul>
            <li>create a custom sword with 10 attack damage (5 hearts) that deals <b>shock</b> damage</li>
            <li>and a custom chestplate with 0 armor that has 50% <b>shock resistance</b></li>
        </ul>
        <p>
            The custom chestplate would reduce the damage dealt by the custom sword with 50%, but it would be
            completely useless against any other weapon (since the chestplate gives 0 armor). The custom sword
            would be quite powerful (5 hearts of damage, which is more than a diamond sword) against anyone who 
            does <b>not</b> wear the custom chestplate, but it would be rather ineffective against players who
            do equip the custom chestplate.
