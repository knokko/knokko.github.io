            This menu can be used to edit custom damage sources, but there is currently not much to configure:
            just the name. Instead, you need to configure custom items or projectiles to use this custom damage
            source, and configure custom armor to resist this damage source. See
            <a href="overview.html">this page</a> for example usage.
