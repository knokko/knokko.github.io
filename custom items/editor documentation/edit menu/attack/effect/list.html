            The attack effect list allows you to configure a list of attack effects. If the list contains a single attack effect that
            sets the target on fire for 100 ticks, this page should look like this:
        </p>
        <img src="list.png" width="50%" />
        <p>
            Click the <i>Add effect</i> button to add a new attack effect to this list of effects. It should take you to the
            <a href="create.html">attack effect type select</a>.
