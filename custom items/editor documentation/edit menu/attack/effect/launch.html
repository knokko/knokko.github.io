        <p>
            The launch attack effect menu can be used to configure a <i>launch</i> attack effect. Launch attack effect will launch
            the target in a specified direction. (For instance, it could knock the target up or knock the target away.) This menu
            should look like this:
        </p>
        <img src="launch.png" width="50%" />
        <h3>Direction</h3>
        <p>
            The button on the right of <i>Direction:</i> can be used to configure the direction to which the target will be launched.
            The options are:
            <ul>
                <li>UP: The target will be knocked upwards (or downwards if you choose a negative speed).</li>
                <li>
                    ATTACK: The target will be knocked in the direction of the attack. If the target is the victim, the victim will be
                    knocked <i>away from</i> the attacker. If the target is the attacker, the attacker will be knocked <i>towards</i>
                    the victim. (At least, if you use a positive speed. If you use a negative speed, the direction will be inverted.)
                </li>
                <li>
                    ATTACK_HORIZONTAL: Works similarly to ATTACK, but the target will <b>never</b> be knocked up or down, even if the
                    attacker is above or below the victim.
                </li>
                <li>
                    ATTACK_SIDE: The target will be knocked left or right. (The choice between left and right is made randomly during
                    each attack.)
                </li>
            </ul>
        </p>
        <h3>Speed</h3>
        <p>
            The speed is basically the 'knockback strength': The higher the speed, the further the knockback/knock-up. Using a negative
            speed will cause the target to be pushed in the opposite of the chosen <i>Direction</i>. The speed should be specified in
            meters per tick (1 minecraft block is 1x1x1 meter big and 1 second = 20 ticks). I think the easiest way to determine the
            right speed is by experimenting with different values.
