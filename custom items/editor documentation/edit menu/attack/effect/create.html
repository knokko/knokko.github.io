        <p>
            The attack effect type select is needed to choose the type of attack effect you want to create. It should look like this:
        </p>
        <img src="create.png" width="50%" />
        <ul>
            <li>
                The <b>Give potion effect</b> attack effect will give a potion effect to the target. Clicking this button will take
                you to the <a href="potion effect.html">potion attack effect menu</a>, where you can configure the potion effect.
            </li>
            <li>
                The <b>Set on fire</b> attack effect will set the target on fire. Clicking this button will take you to the
                <a href="ignite.html">ignite attack effect menu</a>, where you can configure the duration.
            </li>
            <li>
                The <b>Drop weapon or shield</b> attack effect will cause the target to drop their weapon or shield. (They can still
                pick it up afterwards, but this can be rather disruptive in battle.)
            </li>
            <li>
                The <b>Launch</b> attack effect can launch the target. (For instance, knocking the target backwards or upwards.)
                See the <a href="launch.html">launch attack effect menu</a> for more information.
            </li>
            <li>
                The <b>Deal damage</b> attack effect will deal damage to the target or attacker after a given delay.
                <b>
                    Note: players and mobs in minecraft can only take damage ~1 time per second. Attacking more often than this
                    has no effect. So if you choose to use this effect against the <i>victim</i>, you need to ensure the <i>delay</i>
                    is long enough. Using this effect against the <i>attacker</i> should not cause any problems.
                </b>
                See the <a href="deal damage.html">deal damage attack effect menu</a> for more information.
            </li>
            <li>
                The <b>Play sound</b> attack effect will play a sound at the targets location that only the target can hear.
                Clicking this button will take you to the <a href="../../sound/edit.html">sound edit menu</a>, where you can
                configure this sound.
            </li>
        </ul>
    </body>
