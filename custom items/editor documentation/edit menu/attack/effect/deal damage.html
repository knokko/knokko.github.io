            The deal damage attack effect menu can be used to configure a 'deal damage' attack effect. It should look like this:
        </p>
        <img src="deal damage.png" width="50%" />
        <h3>Damage</h3>
        <p>
            The damage that will be dealt to the target. This must be specified in <b>half hearts</b>.
        </p>
        <h3>Delay</h3>
        <p>
            The delay between the time of the attack and the damage caused by this effect, in <b>ticks</b>. If the target of this 
            attack effect is the <b>attacker</b>, you can simply use a delay of 1 tick, which will deal damage nearly right after 
            the attack. If the target of this attack effect is the <b>victim</b>, you probably need a longer delay:
        </p>
        <p>
            Minecraft entities can only take damage ~1 time per second. When they take damage, they become immune to future damage
            for ~1 second. Any attacks that hit during this time will be ignored completely. Since the <b>victim</b> was already
            damaged by the attack that triggered this attack effect, it will ignore the damage of this effect if the delay is too
            short.
