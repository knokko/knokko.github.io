            The attack effects group list allows you to configure the groups of attack effects (or blocking effects). You can use
            this menu to add new groups of attack effects, edit existing groups, or delete groups. If you have 1 group of attack
            effects with 1 attacker effect and 2 victim effects, this page should look like this:
