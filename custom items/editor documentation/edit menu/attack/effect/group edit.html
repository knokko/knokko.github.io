            The attack effect group edit page allows you to configure a group of attack effects. It should look like this:
        </p>
        <img src="group edit.png" width="50%" />
        <p>
            An attack effect group consists of:
        </p>
        <ul>
            <li>A list of attack effects that will be applied to the <b>attacker</b>.</li>
            <li>A list of attack effects that will be applied to the <b>victim</b>.</li>
            <li>
                The chance that the attack effects will be applied. If the chance is smaller than 100%, it is possible that
                none of the attack effects in this group will be apllied during an attack. For instance, if the chance is 20%,
                only 20% of all attacks with this custom weapon will activate the attack effects in this group. In the remaining
                80% of the attacks, nothing special will happen.
            </li>
            <li>
                The original damage threshold. If the <i>original damage</i> of the attack (<b>before</b> considering armor damage reduction)
                is lower than the original damage threshold, none of the attack effects in this group will be activated. 
                This property can be used to ignore weak attacks. If the original damage threshold is 0, all attack effects will
                be activated like usual, regardless of the strength of the attack.
            </li>
            <li>
                The final damage threshold. If the <i>final damage</i> of the attack (<b>after</b> considering armor damage reduction)
                is lower than the final damage threshold, none of the attack effects in this group will be activated.
                This property can be used to ignore weak attacks. If the final damage threshold is 0, all attack effects will
                be activated like usual, regardless of the strength of the attack.
                <b>
                    Note: if an attack is blocked by a shield, the final damage is always 0. So if you are configuring blocking
                    effects, you should always keep the final damage threshold 0!
