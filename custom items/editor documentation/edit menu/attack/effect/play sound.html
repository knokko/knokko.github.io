            The sound attack effect menu can be used to configure attack effects that play sounds. It should look like this:
        </p>
        <img src="play sound.png" width="50%" />
        <p>
            Choosing the <i>sound</i> should be self-explanatory. The volume and pitch determine the volume and pitch of the sound,
            but I don't know much about this myself. Using the default value of 1 seems to work well most of the time.
            <b>Note: only the <i>target</i> of this effect will hear this sound. Other nearby entities won't.</b>
