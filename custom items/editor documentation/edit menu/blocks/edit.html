        <p>
            The block edit menu can be used to create or modify custom blocks. If 
            you just started creating a new block, it should look like this:
        </p>
        <img src="edit.png" width="50%" />
        <ul>
            <li>
                Clicking the <i>Cancel</i> button will take you back to the 
                <a href="overview.html">block overview</a>, <i>without</i> keeping
                any changes you made here.
            </li>
            <li>
                If you are creating a new custom block, there will be a <i>Create</i>
                button. Clicking it will save the block and then take you back to 
                the <a href="overview.html">block overview</a>.
            </li>
            <li>
                If you are editing an existing custom block, there will be an 
                <i>Apply</i> button. Clicking it will save the changes you made 
                and then take you back to the <a href="overview.html">block overview</a>.
            </li>
            <li>
                The <i>Name</i> of the custom block will be used within the 
                generated resourcepack and can be used in the <b>/kci setblock</b>
                command. This is also the name that will be shown in the block 
                overview. This name can't contain any special characters, but this 
                shouldn't be needed because players won't see this name anyway.
            </li>
            <li>
                The <i>Drops</i> determine which items the custom block will drop 
                when it is destroyed. Clicking the <i>Change...</i> button will take 
                you to the <a href="drops/overview.html">block drops overview</a>,
                where you can choose them.
            </li>
            <li>
                The <i>Texture and model</i> determine what the block will look like in-game. Click
                the <i>Change...</i> button to manage it.
            </li>
            <li>
                The <i>Mining speed</i> determines how much time players need to break the block. Clicking the
                <i>Change...</i> button will take you to the <a href="miningspeed.html">mining speed menu</a>,
                where you can configure it.
            </li>
            <li>
                The <i>Sounds</i> can be used to configure which sounds will be played when the player
                performs specific interactions with the block. Note: the player will <b>also</b>
                hear the mushroom block sounds.
            </li>
        </ul>
