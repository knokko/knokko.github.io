        <p>
            The mining speed menu can be used to configure how much time it takes to break a custom block using
            a given tool. It should look like this:
        </p>

        <h2>Mining speed value</h2>
        <p>
            The <i>mining speed value</i> must be an integer between -4 and 25, where a value of -4 makes the block
            nearly unbreakable, and a value of 25 lets the player break it instantly. When you choose a negative
            value, the player will get mining fatique while breaking the block. When you choose a positive value,
            the player will get haste while breaking the block. When the value is 0, the player won't get any
            potion effects. The value directly corresponds to the level of fatique/haste: using value = -3 will give
            players mining fatique 3 and using value = 10 will give players haste 10. An impression of the resulting
            block break times are given below:
        </p>
        <ul>
            <li>
                Value = -4: the block becomes nearly unbreakable (like breaking obsidian without diamond pickaxe)
            </li>
            <li>
                Value = -3: it will take a lot of time to break the block (this is not comparable to any vanilla block)
            </li>
            <li>
                Value = -2: it will take a rather long time to break the block (like breaking stone without a pickaxe)
            </li>
            <li>
                Value = -1: it will take a rather short time to break the block (like breaking stone with a stone pickaxe)
            </li>
            <li>
                Value = 0: it will take a short time to break the block (like breaking stone with a diamond pickaxe)
            </li>
            <li>
                1 &lt;= Value &lt;= 20: it will take slightly less time with each extra level
            </li>
            <li>
                20 &lt; Value &lt;= 25: the block will be broken (almost) instantly
            </li>
        </ul>
        <h2>Mining speed per item</h2>
        <p>
            You can configure the mining speed per item. (For instance, you can give pickaxes higher 
            <i>mining speed values</i>.)
        </p>
        <h3>Default mining speed</h3>
        <p>
            The default mining speed (on the left) is the <i>mining speed value</i> that will be used when none
            of the items on either of the lists on the right are used.
        </p>
        <h3>Vanilla items mining speed</h3>
        <p>
            The middle column is designated to the mining speed for vanilla minecraft items. Using the green + button,
            you can add an entry for any vanilla minecraft item. Each entry has a vanilla item type, a value (the text
            field), and a checkbox to determine whether custom items with that vanilla item type are also allowed.
            If a player tries to break the block with an item in the list, the <i>mining speed value</i> for that item
            will be used instead of the default mining speed. An example is shown below:
        </p>
        <img src="vanilla miningspeed example.png" width="50%" />
        <h3>Custom item mining speed</h3>
        <p>
            The right column is designated to the mining speed for custom items. This is equivalent to the vanilla item
            mining speed column, except that it is for custom items rather than vanilla items.
