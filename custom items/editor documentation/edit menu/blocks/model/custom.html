        <p>
            The custom block model menu can be used to create custom block models. Using a custom model, you
            can give your block any shape you want. Since writing models by hand is rather complicated, I would
            recommend using a tool like Blockbench to do it for you. This menu should look like this:
        </p>
        <img src="custom.png" width="50%" />
        <h3>Model</h3>
        <p>
            Use the <i>Model...</i> button to select your custom model. This uses the same tool as the custom item
            model creator because item models are very similar to block models in minecraft. <b>Note: all custom blocks
            of this plug-in are actually mushroom blocks, which are supposed to be completely solid. If your custom
            model is not, you can get visual glitches (especially when the block is placed adjacent to other blocks).</b>
        </p>
        <h3>Editor texture</h3>
        <p>
            You also need to choose an Editor texture. This texture will be shown in the block list and item list in the
            Editor, but not in-game. This texture is required mostly because of technical reasons. If you don't have a
            nice texture ready, you can use the <i>Load texture...</i> button.
