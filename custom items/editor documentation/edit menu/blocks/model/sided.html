            The sided block model menu can be used to create a block model with a different texture on each side
            of the block. It should look like this:
        </p>
        <img src="sided.png" width="50%" />
        <p>
            You need to select a texture for each side of the block (north, east, south, west, up, and down).
            If the textures are not yet in your list of textures, you can use the <i>Load texture...</i>
            button to select it on-the-fly. Click <i>Done</i> once you have selected each texture.
