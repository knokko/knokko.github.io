        <p>
            The block drop edit menu can be used to create or modify a block drop 
            of a custom block. It should look like this:
        </p>
        <img src="edit.png" width="50%" />
        <p>
            A block drop is more than just an item/block. It consists of:
        </p>
        <ul>
            <li>
                A list of <a href="../../recipes/output table.html">output tables</a>,
                from which each output table will produce (drop) 1 or no items when 
                the block is destroyed.
            </li>
            <li>
                A <i>silk touch requirement</i>. This determines whether players need
                to have silk touch in order to drop items from the output tables
                (or whether silk touch is forbidden). This makes it possible to let
                the block drop different items when a player breaks it with a tool
                that has the silk touch enchantment: you would need 2 block drops:
                1 that requires silk touch and 1 that forbids silk touch.
            </li>
            <li>
                A configuration of <i>required held items</i>. If you enable it,
                the output tables will only drop items when the block is broken
                with the right item (and you can choose which items are the 
                <i>right</i> items). Using required items, you can for instance
                force players to use pickaxes to break the block (if they don't,
                it won't drop any items). See <a href="required items.html">this 
                page</a> for more information.
            </li>
