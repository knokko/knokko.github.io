            The block drops overview can be used to configure the items that will 
            be dropped when a custom block is destroyed. If your block simply has
            100% chance to drop a <i>black_stone</i> block/item, it should look
            like this:
        </p>
        <img src="overview.png" width="50%" />
        <p>
            On the left, there is
        </p>
        <ul>
            <li>
                a <i>Back</i> button. Clicking it will take you back to the 
                <a href="../edit.html">block edit menu</a> of the block you were 
                editing.
            </li>
            <li>
                a <i>Search</i> field. If you type text in there, only the drops 
                whose description contains the text you type will be shown. This 
                could be useful if your block has many drops.
            </li>
            <li>
                an <i>Add drop</i> button. Clicking it will take you to the 
                <a href="edit.html">block drop edit menu</a>, where you can 
                configure it.
            </li>
        </ul>

            The rest of the page is used to display the current list of block 
            drops. For each block drop, there is
