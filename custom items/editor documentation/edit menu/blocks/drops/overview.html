            The block drops overview can be used to configure the items that will 
            be dropped when a custom block is destroyed. If your block simply has
            100% chance to drop a <i>black_stone</i> block/item, it should look
            like this:
        </p>
        <img src="overview.png" width="50%" />
        <p>
            On the left, there is
        </p>
        <ul>
            <li>
                a <i>Back</i> button. Clicking it will take you back to the 
                <a href="../edit.html">block edit menu</a> of the block you were 
                editing.
            </li>
            <li>
                a <i>Search</i> field. If you type text in there, only the drops 
                whose description contains the text you type will be shown. This 
                could be useful if your block has many drops.
            </li>
            <li>
                an <i>Add drop</i> button. Clicking it will take you to the 
                <a href="edit.html">block drop edit menu</a>, where you can 
                configure it.
            </li>
        </ul>
        <p>
            The rest of the page is used to display the current list of block 
            drops. Note that the block drops displayed here are somewhat more
            complicated than you might expect: each block drop can drop
            multiple items and have some conditiosn like required items. For 
            each block drop, there is
        </p>
        <ul>
            <li>a description/summary on the right of an optional texture.</li>
            <li>
                an <i>Edit</i> button on the right of the description. Clicking it
                will take you to the <a href="edit.html">block drop edit menu</a>,
                where you can edit it.
            </li>
            <li>
                a <i>Copy</i> button between the <i>Edit</i> and <i>Delete</i>
                button. Clicking it will take you to the block drop edit menu,
                where you can create a new block drop. But, you won't be 
                creating it from scratch: all fields will be filled with the 
                values of the block drop you're copying.
            </li>
            <li>
                a <i>Delete</i> button on the right. Clicking it will remove the 
                block drop.
            </li>
        </ul>
    </body>
