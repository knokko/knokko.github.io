        <p>
            The block overview shows all your custom blocks and their IDs. From the 
            block overview, you can also create new blocks and edit existing blocks.
            If you have 2 custom blocks, it should look like this:
        </p>
        <img src="overview.png" width="50%" />
        <p>
            On the left, there is:
        </p>
        <ul>
            <li>
                a <i>Back</i> button. Clicking it will take you back to the
                <a href="../index.html">item set edit menu</a>.
            </li>
            <li>
                a <i>Search</i> field. If you type anything in this field,
                only the blocks whose name contains the typed text will be 
                shown. Use this to find blocks if you have many.
            </li>
            <li>
                a <i>Create block</i> button. Clicking it will take you 
                to the <a href="edit.html">block edit menu</a>, where you can 
                create a new custom block.
            </li>
        </ul>
        <p>
            The actual list of custom blocks is shown on the right.
        </p>
        <ul>
            <li>The name of each custom block is shown on the right of its texture.</li>
            <li>
                The <i>numertical ID</i> of each custom block is shown between 
                brackets on the right of the blocks name. See <a href="id.html">
                this page</a> for technical information about numerical IDs.
            </li>
            <li>
                Clicking the <i>Edit</i> button of a custom block will take you 
                to the <a href="edit.html">block edit menu</a>, where you can edit 
                the corresponding block.
            </li>
            <li>
                Clicking the <i>Copy</i> button will also take you to the block 
                edit menu. There, you will be able to create a new custom block,
                but all fields will automatically be filled in with the values
                of the original block. You will need to change at least the name
                before you can finish the copy.
            </li>
        </ul>
    </body>
