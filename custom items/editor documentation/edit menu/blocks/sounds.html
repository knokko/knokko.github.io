        <p>
            The block sounds menu can be used to configure the sounds of a custom block. It should look like this:
        </p>
        <img src="sounds.png" width="50%" />
        <p><b>Note: the vanilla mushroom block sounds will also be played, regardless of what you configure here.</b></p>
        <p>
            Each sound is optional. You can choose a sound by clicking on the corresponding button and you can
            remove a sound (after you have selected one) by clicking on the red cross on the left 
            of the corresponding button.
        </p>
