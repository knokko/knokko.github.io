            The Export menu is needed to <b>export</b> your items. Exporting means moving your items and textures
            to your server. In this menu, you can customize the export options and click <b>Continue</b> when you
            are satisfied. Each of the export options will be explained below. The export menu should look like this:
        </p>
        <img src="export.png" width="50%" />
        <h3>MC version</h3>
        <p>The minecraft version of your server</p>
        <h3>Export mode</h3>
        <p>
            The export mode determines how complicated the export procedure will be. The 3 options are:
        </p>
        <ul>
            <li>
                <b>Automatic:</b> The easiest export mode and the default export mode. If you choose this mode and
                click <b>Continue</b>, you need to copy a command from the Editor and paste it in your server, after
                which the plug-in will take care of the rest. This export mode doesn't allow you to modify your
                resource pack.
            </li>
            <li>
                <b>Mixed:</b> This export mode is more complicated than <b>Automatic</b>, but easier than
                <b>Manual</b>. If you choose this mode and click <b>Continue</b>, the Editor will store your item
                data in a file called <i>items.cis.txt</i> and store your resource pack in <i>resource-pack.zip</i>.
                You should copy both of these files to <i>YourServer/plugins/CustomItems</i>, after optionally
                modifying your resource pack. <b>Note:</b> you can only use this export mode if you have access to
                the file system of your server (some server hosting services like Aternos might deny this).
            </li>
            <li>
                <b>Manual:</b> The most complicated export mode. If you choose this mode and click <b>Continue</b>, 
                the Editor will store your item data in a file called <i>items.cis.txt</i> and store your resource 
                pack in <i>resource-pack.zip</i>. You should copy <i>items.cis.txt</i> to 
                <i>YourServer/plugins/CustomItems</i>. Furthermore, if you want your players to see the custom
                textures, you need to ensure that your players use the resource pack. How you do this, is up to you.
            </li>
        </ul>
        <p>
            If you choose <b>Automatic</b> or <b>Mixed</b>, your resource pack will be hosted on a free and shared 
            hosting server provided by me (the author of this plug-in). If you are not satisfied with the
            network speed of this hosting server, you should choose <b>Manual</b> and host the resource pack
            yourself, for instance using Dropbox.
        </p>
        <h3>The other settings</h3>
        <p>The other settings are only applicable when using the <b>Automatic</b> or <b>Mixed</b> export mode.</p>
        <h3>Reload message</h3>
        <p>
            This message will be broadcasted to all online players whenever the resource pack has been changed.
        </p>
        <h3>Resource pack host IP</h3>
        <p>
            If you don't want to use the default resource pack hosting server, you can host your own resource pack
            hosting service and put its IP address or host name here. If you really want to do this, you need to
            run the <a href="https://github.com/knokko/resource-pack-host">resource pack host software</a> on your
            own host. <b>Note: the default resource pack host should be fine for most people.</b>
        </p>
        <h3>Kick players who reject the resource pack</h3>
        <p>
            Whether the plug-in should kick all players who reject the server resource pack. Enable this if you
            really want everyone to use the resource pack.
        </p>
        <h3>Warning message</h3>
        <p>
            If you do <b>not</b> enable <i>Kick players who reject the resource pack</i>, this message will be
            sent to all players who reject the server resource pack. Unless you leave this field empty, in
            which case no messages will be sent.
        </p>
        <h3>Kick message</h3>
        <p>
            If you <b>enable</b> <i>Kick players who reject the resource pack</i>, this message will be
            sent as 'reason' to players who are kicked because they rejected the resource pack.
        </p>
        <h3>Kick players who fail to download the resource pack</h3>
        <p>
            Whether the plug-in should kick all players who fail to download the server resource pack. This will
            probably only happen if something is wrong with the server resource pack, so I would only use this
            if the resource pack is extremely important.
        </p>
        <h3>Warning message</h3>
        <p>
            If you do <b>not</b> enable <i>Kick players who fail to download the resource pack</i>, this message will be
            sent to all players who fail to download the server resource pack. Unless you leave this field empty, in
            which case no messages will be sent.
        </p>
        <h3>Kick message</h3>
        <p>
            If you <b>enable</b> <i>Kick players who fail to download the resource pack</i>, this message will be
            sent as 'reason' to players who are kicked because they failed to download the resource pack.
