        <h3>Hotkeys</h3>
        <p>

        <h3>Apply</h3>
        <p>
            The 'Apply' button does the same thing as the 'Cancel' button except that it does remember the changes you have made.
            Do note that the changes are not saved physically until you have pressed the 'Save' button in the <a href="../">Item Set Edit Menu</a>.
        </p>
        <h3>Ingredient</h3>
        <p>
            The 'Ingredient' button is the button that contains the name of the item that is part of this crafting recipe. 
            There can be multiple or none of these buttons on the same page.
            Clicking on this button opens up a submenu where you can change which type of item will be part of the crafting recipe.

        </p>
        <h3>Red X</h3>
        <p>
            Pressing this red x will delete the ingredient from the crafting recipe.
            NOTE: At the time of writing this there is a bug where the space used by the ingredient button and the red X remains empty.
            This is currently being looked at. Please be patient, it will be fixed soon<sup>TM</sup>.
