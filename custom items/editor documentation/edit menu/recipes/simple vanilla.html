            The simple vanilla item selection menu is the menu from which you can 
            select standard minecraft items as ingredients (or final product) to 
            crafting recipes, container recipes, and a few other things. It should 
            look like this:
        </p>
        <img src="simple vanilla.png" width="50%" />
        <p>
            The menu consists out of the item buttons in the middle, a search bar on 
            the left, and a cancel button on the left.
        </p>
        <p>
            The 'Cancel' button will take you back to the previous menu, without selecting
            an item.
        </p>
        <p>
            The search bar enables you to search through the list quickly. 
            Simply type in the name of the item you wish to add and every item that does 
            not include what is typed will disappear from the list.
            Clearing the search bar will let every item appear in the list again.
        </p>
        <p>
            The item buttons take you back to the previous menu and select that item 
            as ingredient or result for the recipe. In this example, pressing the 
            'Acacia planks' button will add an 'Acacia planks' to the crafting recipe 
            (either as ingredient or as the final product, depending on how you got 
            to this menu). If there is a version indicated behind the name, then you 
            can't use this on all versions of minecraft. Note: many items were renamed
            or flattened in minecraft 1.13, so the item you are looking for might have 
            a slightly different name (for instance, workbench is needed in mc 1.12
            and crafting table is needed in mc 1.13).
