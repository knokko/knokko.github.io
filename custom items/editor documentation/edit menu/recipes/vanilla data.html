        <p>
            The vanilla item with data selection menu is the menu from which you can add items as ingredients (or final product) to crafting recipes.
            It should look like this:
        </p>
        <img src="vanilla data.png" width="50%" />
        <p>
            The menu consists out of the item buttons in the middle, a search bar on the left, a data value input bar on the left and a cancel button on the left.
        </p>
        <p>
            The 'Cancel' button will take you back to the previous menu (being <a href="shapeless.html">Create Shapeless Recipe</a> or <a href="shaped.html">Create Shaped Recipe</a>), 
            disregarding the changes you made. Note that there is no way to recover the changes made after pressing the 'Cancel' button.
        </p>
        <p>
            The search bar enables you to search through the list more quickly. 
            Simply type in the name of the item you wish to add and every item that does not match what is typed will disappear from the list.
            Clearing the earch bar will let every item appear in the list again.
        </p>
        <p>
            The 'Data value' input bar contains the data value that is added to the item when you press one of the item buttons.
            This is especially important for blocks that have different versions (like coloured wool) in minecraft versions 1.12 and earlier.
        </p>
        <p>
            The item buttons direct you back to the previous menu (being <a href="shapeless.html">Create Shapeless Recipe</a> or <a href="shaped.html">Create Shaped Recipe</a>),
            and adding that item to that recipe. In this example, pressing the 'Acacia planks' button will add an 'Acacia planks' to the crafting recipe 
            (either as ingredient or as the final product, depending on how you got to this menu). 
            If there is a version indicated behind the name, then you can only use this recipe on servers with that minecraft version or higher.
