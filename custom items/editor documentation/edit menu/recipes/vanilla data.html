        <p>
            The vanilla item with data selection menu is the menu from which you 
            can select standard minecraft items with a chosen data value as 
            ingredient (or final product) of a crafting recipes. This datavalue 
            is just an integer between 0 and 16. It is only used in minecraft 1.12
            and earlier versions to distinguish for instance the colors of dyes and 
            wool. This menu should look like this:
        </p>
        <img src="vanilla data.png" width="50%" />
        <p>
            The menu consists out of the item buttons in the middle, a search bar on
            the left, a data value input field on the left and a cancel button on 
            the left.
        </p>
        <p>
            The 'Cancel' button will take you back to the previous menu without 
            selection an item or datavalue.
        </p>
        <p>
            The search bar enables you to search through the list quickly. 
            Simply type in the name of the item you wish to add and every item that 
            doesn't include what is typed will disappear from the list.
            Clearing the earch bar will let every item appear in the list again.
        </p>
        <p>
            The 'Data value' input bar contains the data value that is added to the 
            item that you have selected or will select.
            This is only useful important for blocks and items that have different 
            variants (like coloured wool) in minecraft versions 1.12 and earlier.
            Datavalues were removed in minecraft 1.13 and thus won't have any effect
            in later versions.
        </p>
        <p>
            The item buttons will select the corresponding item as the base item of
            the ingredient or result of the recipe.
        </p>
        <p>
            If you have selected an item, an <i>Ok</i> button will appear. Clicking 
            it will select the chosen item and datavalue as ingredient or result of 
            the recipe. (In this case, it would be black wool.)
