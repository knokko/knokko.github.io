        <p>
            The cooking recipe edit menu can be used to create or edit custom (blast) furnace recipes,
            smoker recipes, and campfire recipes. It should look like this:
        </p>

        <h3>Input</h3>
        <p>
            The input/ingredient of the cooking recipe. Due to technical reasons, the input must <b>not</b>
            be the input of a vanilla furnace recipe (like iron ore). Due to another technical reason, when multiple
            custom cooking recipes have the same internal input item, at most 1 of them can have a result that can stack.
        </p>
        <h3>Result</h3>
        <p>
            The result/output of the cooking recipe.
        </p>
        <h3>Cooking time</h3>
        <p>
            The cooking time/duration of the recipe, in ticks (20 ticks = 1 second). The default duration is
            200 ticks, which is 10 seconds. This is also the duration of vanilla minecraft furnace recipes.
            When the recipe is performed in a smoker or blast furnace, the cooking time is twice as short.
            When the recipe is performed on a campfire, the cooking time is 3 times as long.
            Due to technical reasons, all custom cooking recipes that use the same internal input item must have
            the same cooking time.
        </p>
        <h3>Experience</h3>
        <p>
            The amount of experience that will be stored in the (blast) furnace/smoker after the recipe is completed.
            For reference, smeling cobblestone gives 0.1 experience and smelting raw iron gives 0.7 experience.
            Due to technical reasons, all custom cooking recipes that use the same internal input item must have
            the same experience.
        </p>
        <h3>Recipe types</h3>
        <p>
            You can choose whether this custom cooking recipe works in (blast) furnaces, smokers,
            and/or campfires. When you allow smokers and/or blast furnaces, the cooking time in these
            blocks will be twice as short as the cooking time specified here. When you allow campfires,
            the cooking time on a campfire will be 3 times as long.
