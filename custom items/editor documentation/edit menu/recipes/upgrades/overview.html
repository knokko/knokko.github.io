            The upgrade overview can be used to view, create, and edit <i>upgrades</i>. Upgrades can be used in
            custom crafting recipes or container recipes to <i>upgrade</i> (improve) one of the ingredients. Upgrades
            can consist of enchantments, attribute modifiers, damage resistances, and variables. Check 
            <a href="edit.html">this page</a> for details. 
        </p>
        <p>
            For instance, you could create an upgrade that adds the feather falling enchantment and create a crafting 
            recipe that turns leather boots and 8 feathers into leather boots with the feather falling enchantment.
            Note that upgrade recipes consist of 2 parts:
        </p>
        <ul>
            <li>The upgrades, which define the enchantments, attribute modifiers, etc...</li>
            <li>The upgrade recipes, which define which items can be upgraded, and at which cost</li>
        </ul>
        <p>
            This overview, the upgrade overview, only deals with <i>The upgrades</i>, and <b>not</b> with the
            <i>recipes</i>. If you have a single upgrade called sharpness2, it should look like this:
