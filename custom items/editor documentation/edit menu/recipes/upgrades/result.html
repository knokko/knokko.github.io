        <p>
            The upgrade result menu can be used to create or edit <i>upgrade results</i>. Upgrade results can add 0 or
            more <a href="overview.html">upgrades</a> to an ingredient of the recipe. Furthermore, upgrade results can
            optionally repair the item, remove previous enchantments/upgrades, or turn the ingredient into something else.
            The upgrade result menu should look like this:
        </p>
        <img src="result.png" width="50%" />
        <h3>Upgrades (optional)</h3>
        <p>
            Click the <b>Upgrades...</b> button to choose which <a href="overview.html">upgrades</a> should be added to
            the ingredient. You can choose 0 or more upgrades.
        </p>
        <h3>Repair (optional)</h3>
        <p>
            How much the ingredient should be repaired when it is upgraded. Use a positive percentage to repair the item,
            use a negative percentage to damage the ingredient, and use 0 to keep the durability the same. This is ignored
            for unbreakable items (and simple items that don't have durability).
        </p>
        <h3>New type (optional)</h3>
        <p>
            The new item type of the ingredient. You can use this to turn the ingredient into a different item, while
            keeping properties like enchantments or durability. By default, the new type is <b>null</b>, which will
            cause the ingredient to keep its own item type.
        </p>
        <h3>Keep old upgrades</h3>
        <p>
            Whether the ingredient should keep its existing upgrades. If you uncheck this, the ingredient will lose all of
            its previous upgrades (including enchantments). This can be useful if you want some 'exclusive' upgrades.
        </p>
        <h3>Keep old enchantments</h3>
        <p>
            Whether the ingredient should keep its <b>non-KCI</b> enchantments (the enchantments that were for instance
            added by an enchanting table). If you uncheck this, the ingredient will only keep the enchantments given by
            previous upgrades (if <i>Keep old enchantments</i> is still checked) and the <i>default enchantments</i>
            (only applicable to custom items).
        </p>
        <h3>Choose ingredient (required)</h3>
        <p>
            Click the <i>Choose ingredient...</i> to choose which ingredient should be upgraded.
        </p>
