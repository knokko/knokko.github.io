        <p>
            The output type selection menu is used to choose the results of
            crafting recipes or container recipes. It should look like this:
        </p>
        <img src="output type select.png" width="50%" />
        <ul>
            <li>
                Clicking the 'Cancel' button will take you back to the previous
                menu, without keeping any changes you made here.
            </li>
            <li>
                If you have selected an item, the 'Select' button should appear.
                Clicking this will keep the changes you made, and then take you 
                back to the previous menu.
            </li>
            <li>
                The edit field on the right of 'Amount:' can be used to choose 
                the amount (the stacksize) of the output item. This must be an
                integer between 1 and 64.
            </li>
        </ul>
        <p>
            The remaining 4 buttons can be used to choose which item you want
            as output.
        </p>
        <ul>
            <li>
                The 'Custom item' button will take you to the 
                <a href="custom.html">custom item selection menu</a> where you 
                can choose which custom item you want as output.
            </li>
            <li>
                The 'Simple vanilla item' button will take you to the 
                <a href="simple vanilla.html">simple vanilla item selection menu</a>
                where you can choose which vanilla minecraft item you want as 
                output.
            </li>
            <li>
                The 'Vanilla item with datavalue' button will take you to the 
                <a href="vanilla data.html">data vanilla item selection menu</a>
                where you can choose which vanilla minecraft item with which data 
                value you want as output. Note that datavalues were removed in 
                minecraft 1.13.
            </li>
            <li>
                The 'Copy from server' will take you to the item copy menu where you 
                can paste the data of an itemstack you have on your server. This
                should allow you to use any item stack on your server, no matter how
                complex it is. You could even use this on custom items from this 
                plug-in, but using the 'Custom item' button above should be much
                easier.
                This menu hould explain itself when you visit it in the editor.
            </li>
