        <p>This plug-in provides several types of custom recipes:</p>
        <ul>
            <li><a href="overview.html">Crafting recipes</a> (shaped + shapeless)</li>
            <li><a href="cooking overview.html">Cooking recipes</a> ((blast) furnace + smoker + campfire)</li>
            <li><a href="smithing overview.html">Smithing recipes</a></li>
        </ul>
        <p>
            Furthermore, it provides so-called <a href="upgrades/overview.html">upgrades</a> that can be used to create
            recipes that modify ingredients.
        </p>
        <h3>Minecraft versions</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>Crafting recipes are supported in any MC version that is supported by this plug-in.</li>
            <li>
                Furnace recipes are only supported on MC 1.13 and later because the Bukkit API became much
                better in MC 1.13.
            </li>
            <li>
                The other cooking recipes are only supported on MC 1.14 and later because the corresponding blocks
                were added in MC 1.14.
            </li>
            <li>
                Smithing recipes are only supported on MC 1.20 and later because the smithing recipe format of
                minecraft changed in MC 1.20. This plug-in only supports the new format.
            </li>
