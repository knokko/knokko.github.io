        <p>
            The smithing recipe edit menu can be used to create or edit custom smithing recipes.
            It should look like this:
        </p>

        <h3>Ingredients</h3>
        <p>
            Smithing recipes need 3 ingredients: the template (left slot), the tool (middle slot), and the material
            (right slot). Players would probably expect the <i>template</i> ingredient to be a vanilla template or
            custom template item, but you are free to choose anything you want. The same holds for the <i>tool</i>
            and <i>material</i> ingredients.
        </p>
        <h3>Required permission</h3>
        <p>
            When you leave the required permission empty, any player can perform the smithing recipe.
            When it is non-empty, only players with the given permission can perform the recipe.
