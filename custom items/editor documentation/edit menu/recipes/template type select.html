            The template type select menu is used to choose what kind of template 
            recipe you would like to add. Template recipes speed up the process of 
            creating common kinds of recipes like pickaxes. For instance, when 
            creating a template pickaxe, you only need to select a stick ingredient
            and a gem ingredient once rather than 2 and 3 times. This menu should 
            look like this:
        </p>
        <img src="template type select.png" width="50%" />
        <ul>
            <li>
                Clicking the 'Cancel' button will take you back to the 
                <a href="overview.html">recipe overview</a>, without creating a 
                new template recipe.
            </li>
            <li>
                Clicking any of the other buttons will take you to the
                <a href="template recipe creation.html">template recipe creation menu</a>,
                where you can configure the ingredients and finally create a shaped 
                recipe.
            </li>
        </ul>
