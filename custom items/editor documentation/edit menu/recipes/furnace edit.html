            The furnace recipe edit menu can be used to create or edit custom furnace recipes.
            It should look like this:

        <h3>Input</h3>
        <p>
            The input/ingredient of the furnace recipe. Due to technical reasons, the input must <b>not</b>
            be the input of a vanilla furnace recipe (like iron ore). Due to another technical reason, when multiple
            custom furnace recipes have the same internal input item, at most 1 of them can have a result that can stack.
        </p>
        <h3>Result</h3>
        <p>
            The result/output of the furnace recipe.
        </p>
        <h3>Cooking time</h3>
        <p>
            The cooking time/duration of the recipe, in ticks (20 ticks = 1 second). The default duration is
            200 ticks, which is 10 seconds. This is also the duration of vanilla minecraft furnace recipes.
            Due to technical reasons, all custom furnace recipes that use the same internal input item must have
            the same cooking time.
        </p>
        <h3>Experience</h3>
        <p>
            The amount of experience that will be stored in the furnace after the recipe is completed.
            For reference, smeling cobblestone gives 0.1 experience and smelting raw iron gives 0.7 experience.
            Due to technical reasons, all custom furnace recipes that use the same internal input item must have
            the same experience.
