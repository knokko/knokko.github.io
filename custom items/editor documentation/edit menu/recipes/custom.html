        <p>
            The custom item selection menu is the menu from which you can add custom items as ingredients (or final product) to crafting recipes.
            It should look like this:
        </p>
        <img src="custom.png" width="50%" />
        <p>
            The menu consists out of the item buttons in the middle and a cancel button on the left.
        </p>
        <p>
            The 'Cancel' button will take you back to the previous menu (being <a href="shapeless.html">Create Shapeless Recipe</a> or <a href="shaped.html">Create Shaped Recipe</a>), 
            disregarding the changes you made. Note that there is no way to recover the changes made after pressing the 'Cancel' button.
        </p>
        <p>
            The item buttons direct you back to the previous menu (being <a href="shapeless.html">Create Shapeless Recipe</a> or <a href="shaped.html">Create Shaped Recipe</a>),
            and adding that item to that recipe. In this example, pressing the 'ruby' button will add a 'ruby' to the crafting recipe (either as ingredient or as the final product, 
            depending on how you got to this menu).
