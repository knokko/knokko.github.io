            The custom item selection menu is the menu from which you can add custom 
            items as ingredients (or final product) to crafting recipes, container 
            recipes, and a couple of other things. It should look like this:
        </p>
        <img src="custom.png" width="50%" />
        <p>
            The menu consists out of the item buttons in the middle and a cancel 
            button on the left.
        </p>
        <p>
            The 'Cancel' button will take you back to the previous menu.
        </p>
        <p>
            The item buttons direct you back to the previous menu, and select that 
            custom item as the ingredient or result. In this example, pressing the 
            'ruby' button will select a 'ruby'.
