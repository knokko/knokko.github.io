        <p>
            The ingredient constraints menu can be used to add additional constraints to (crafting recipe)
            ingredients. It should look like this:
        </p>
        <img src="edit.png" width="50%" />
        <p>
            Currently, there are 3 types of constraints:
        </p>
        <ul>
            <li>
                <i>Durability constraints</i>: the remaining durability of the ingredient must be above or below a specific 
                percentage of its maximum durability (this only makes sense for breakable tools)
            </li>
            <li>
                <i>Enchantment constraints</i>: the ingredient must have specific enchantments, possibly between
                specific levels (this only makes sense for items that can be enchanted)
            </li>
            <li>
                <i>Variable constraints</i>: the ingredient must have a specific value for a specific <i>variable</i>.
                Variables are a rather advanced feature of this plug-in that make it possible to keep track of which
                <i>upgrade recipes</i> have been used on an item.
            </li>
        </ul>
