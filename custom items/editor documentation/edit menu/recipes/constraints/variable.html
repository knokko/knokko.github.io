            The variable constraints menu can be used to add variable constraings to (crafting recipe) ingredients.
            If you have 1 variable constraint, it should look like this:
        </p>
        <img src="variable.png" width="50%" />
        <p>
            Variable (constraints) are a rather complicated feature of this plug-in. A variable is basically a piece
            of text with an associated integer value. By default, items do not have any variables, but you can add them
            with <i>upgrade recipes</i>. For instance, you can create an upgrade recipe that will give an item a
            "test" variable with associated value 1. If you then add a variable constraint here that states
            <b>test = 1</b>, only items that were previously upgraded by that upgrade recipe can be used as ingredient
            in this recipe.
