            The enchantment constraints menu can be used to configure the enchantment constraints of a (crafting recipe)
            ingredient. If you have 1 enchantment constraint, it should look like this:
        </p>
        <img src="enchantment.png" width="50%" />
        <p>
            You can use the <i>Add new</i> button to add a new enchantment constraint and you can use the red X button
            on the right of an existing constraint to remove it. Each enchantment constraing requires the item to have
            a specific enchantment at, above, or below a specific level (where a level of 0 indicates that the item
            does <b>not</b> have the enchantment). For instance, in the screenshot above, items must have the
            sharpness enchantment at level 4 or higher.
