        <p>
            The Choose ingredient menu can be used to select an ingredient for a 
            crafting recipe, container recipe, or the repair item of a custom tool 
            (the repair item of a tool is technically very similar to the ingredient 
            of a recipe, so the same menu can be used for both). It should look like
            this:
        </p>
        <img src="choose ingredient.png" width="50%" />
        <p><b>
            Note: if you want a remaining item, you need to select
            it <i>before</i> choosing the type of ingredient.
        </b></p>
        <ul>
            <li>
                Clicking the <i>Cancel</i> button will take you back to the menu you 
                came from, without adding or replacing the ingredient.
            </li>
            <li>
                The <i>Remaining item</i> can be used to replace the ingredient with 
                another item rather than removing it upon crafting. For instance,
                you can choose a bucket as the remaining item of a lava bucket
                ingredient. When the result item is crafted, the lava bucket will be 
                replaced with an empty bucket rather than disappearing entirely.<br>
                <b>Note: the Remaining item is basically a <i>result</i>, so when you click on the Change button,
                you can configure it in the <a href="choose result.html">Choose result menu</a>.</b><br>
                Empty ingredients can <b>not</b> have a remaining item.
            </li>
        </ul>
        <p>
            The other buttons can be used to choose the type of ingredient. Currently, this plug-in supports 3
            types of ingredients:
        </p>
        <ul>
            <li>
                Custom item ingredients. You can of course use custom items from this plug-in, but you can also use
                custom items from other plug-ins, 
                <i>
                    if these plug-ins have integration with either <a href="https://www.spigotmc.org/resources/mimic.82515/">Mimic</a>
                    or <a href="https://www.spigotmc.org/resources/itembridge-save-items-and-use-them-wherever-you-want-including-other-plugins-best-w-customitems.77080/">ItemBridge</a>.
                </i>
                You could even use custom items from this plug-in via Mimic or ItemBridge, but I recommend against doing that because
                it would disable some validation checks that might save you someday. (For instance, you will encounter a validation
                error if you remove a custom item that is still being used as ingredient in a custom crafting recipe, but this won't
                work if you do it via Mimic or ItemBridge.)
            </li>
            <li>
                Vanilla minecraft item ingredients. These can be items and blocks from vanilla minecraft, for instance
                a stick or a stone. In minecraft 1.12, you can choose from <i>simple</i> vanilla items and vanilla items
                with a <i>data value</i>. In minecraft 1.12, <i>data values</i> are needed to use for instance colored wool.
                In minecraft 1.13 and later, minecraft no longer has <i>data values</i> and instead uses a different item/block
                for each variant.
            </li>
            <li>
                Finally, you can choose to use an <i>Empty</i> ingredient. When you choose an empty ingredient,
                the corresponding slot must <b>not</b> contain any items. Note: empty ingredients are not allowed in shapeless
                crafting recipes (if you specify less than 9 ingredients in a shapeless recipe, all other ingredients are
                implicitly Empty ingredients).
