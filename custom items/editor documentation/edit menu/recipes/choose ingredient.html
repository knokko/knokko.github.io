        <p>
            The ingredient selection menu can be used to select an ingredient for a 
            crafting recipe, container recipe, or the repair item of a custom tool 
            (the repair item of a tool is technically very similar to the ingredient 
            of a recipe, so the same menu can be used for both). It should look like
            this:
        </p>
        <img src="choose ingredient.png" width="50%" />
        <p><b>
            Note: if you want a custom amount or remaining item, you need to select
            it <i>before</i> clicking on <i>Custom Item</i>, <i>Simple vanilla item</i>,
            or <i>Vanilla item with datavalue</i>.
        </b></p>
        <ul>
            <li>
                Clicking the <i>Cancel</i> button will take you back to the menu you 
                came from, without adding or replacing the ingredient.
            </li>
            <li>
                The <i>Amount</i> field can be used to let the ingredient require a 
                stacksize that is larger than 1, and decrease that stacksize by more 
                than 1. This makes it possible to add crafting recipes that require 
                for instance 10 iron ingots (which would normally be impossible
                because a crafting table only has 9 slots).
            </li>
            <li>
                The <i>Remaining item</i> can be used to replace the ingredient with 
                another item rather than removing it upon crafting. For instance,
                you can choose a bucket as the remaining item of a lava bucket
                ingredient. When the result item is crafted, the lava bucket will be 
                replaced with an empty bucket rather than disappearing entirely.
            </li>
            <li>
                Clicking <i>Custom Item</i> will take you to the 
                <a href="custom.html">custom item selection menu</a>, where you can 
                choose a custom item as the ingredient.
            </li>
            <li>
                Clicking <i>Simple vanilla item</i> will take you to the 
                <a href="simple vanilla.html">simple vanilla item selection menu</a>,
                where you can choose a simple vanilla item as ingredient (a standard
                minecraft item like a stick).
            </li>
            <li>
                Clicking <i>Vanilla item with datavalue</i> will take you to the 
                <a href="vanilla data.html">vanilla item with data selection menu</a>,
                where you can choose a vanilla item plus a data value as ingredient.
                Note: this data value is just an integer between 0 and 16 used before 
                minecraft 1.13 to distinguish things like the different colors of wool.
            </li>
        </ul>
