            The crafting recipe overview is the root menu from which you can add, edit and delete crafting recipes.
            It should look like this:
        </p>
        <img src="overview.png" width="50%" />
        <p>
            The create recipe buttons, the copy button and the edit button will open up a submenu where you can edit the crafting recipe.
            For more information about that process, head over to the individual pages of the submenus:
            <ul>
                <li><a href="shaped.html">Create shaped Recipe</a></li>
                <li><a href="shapeless.html">Create shapeless Recipe</a></li>
                <li>
                    <a href="template type select.html">Create template recipe</a> is 
                    a sort of shortcut for creating common kind of shaped recipes (like 
                    swords, pickaxes, chestplates...)
                </li>
            </ul>
            The edit and copy buttons open the submenu of the type of recipe that is edited/copied.
            In the case of copy, clicking the create/apply button will create a new entry with the modified recipe.
            In the case of edit, clicking the create/apply button will replace the recipe of that entry with the modified recipe.
