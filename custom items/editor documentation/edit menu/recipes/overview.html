            The recipe menu is the root menu from which you can add, edit and delete crafting recipes.
            It should look like this:
        </p>
        <img src="recipe menu.png" width="50%" />
        <p>
            The menu consist of the create recipe buttons on the left, a back button at the top left and the existing recipes on the right. Each recipe entry consists out of:
            <ul>
                <li>Name of the item that is crafted</li>
                <li>Edit button to edit the recipe</li>
                <li>Copy button to copy the recipe into a new, indpendent entry</li>
                <li>Delete button to delete the recipe</li>
            </ul>
        </p>
        <p>
            The 'Back' button will take you back to the <a href="../">Item Set Edit Menu</a>, remembering the changes you made.
            Do note that these changes are not physically saved to the file unless you press the 'Save' button in the aforementioned menu.
        </p>
        <p>
            The create recipe buttons, the copy button and the edit button will open up a submenu where you can edit the crafting recipe.
            For more information about that process, head over to the individual pages of the submenus:
            <ul>
                <li><a href="shaped.html">Create Shaped Recipe</a></li>
                <li><a href="shapeless.html">Create Shapeless Recipe</a></li>
            </ul>
            The edit and copy buttons open the submenu of the type of recipe that is edited/copied.
            In the case of copy, clicking the create/apply button will create a new entry with the modified recipe.
            In the case of edit, clicking the create/apply button will replace the recipe of that entry with the modified recipe.
