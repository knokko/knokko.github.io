        <p>
            The Edit ingredient menu can be used to select an ingredient for a 
            crafting recipe, container recipe, or the repair item of a custom tool 
            (the repair item of a tool is technically very similar to the ingredient 
            of a recipe, so the same menu can be used for both). It should look like
            this:
        </p>
        <img src="edit ingredient.png" width="50%" />
        <p>
            An ingredient consists of 3 parts:
        </p>
        <ul>
            <li>The type (custom item or vanilla item)</li>
            <li>The remaining item (for instance an empty bucket when the type is a lava bucket)</li>
            <li>The constraints (for instance durability requirements)</li>
        </ul>
        <p>
            Each type is explained in more detail below. Note: the remaining item and constraints are not available for
            <b>empty</b> ingredients.
        </p>
        <h3>Type</h3>
        <p>
            The most important part of an ingredient is its type. The type can be a vanilla item (possibly with data value
            in minecraft 1.12), a custom item (either from this plug-in or from a third-party plug-in with either ItemBridge
            or Mimic integration), or empty (this option is not always available).
        </p>
        <p>
            The currently selected type is shown at the top of the page ("Currently Stone" in the screenshot above).
            To change it, you need to click one of the following buttons:
        </p>
        <ul>
            <li><i>from this plug-in</i>: choose a custom item from this plug-in</li>
            <li>
                <i>from another plug-in with Mimic integration</i>: choose a custom item from a third-party plug-in
                that has <a href="https://www.spigotmc.org/resources/mimic.82515/">Mimic</a> integration
            </li>
            <li>
                <i>from another plug-in with ItemBridge integration</i>: choose a custom item from a third-party plug-in
                that has 
                <a href="https://www.spigotmc.org/resources/itembridge-save-items-and-use-them-wherever-you-want-including-other-plugins-best-w-customitems.77080/">ItemBridge</a>
                integration
            </li>
            <li><i>simple</i>: choose an item from vanilla minecraft</li>
            <li>
                <i>with data value (1.12)</i>: choose an item from vanilla minecraft with a data value
                (in minecraft 1.12 and earlier, data values were used for things like wool colors and wood types)
            </li>
            <li><i>Set empty</i>: the slot that corresponds to this ingredient must be empty</li>
        </ul>
        <h3>Remaining item</h3>
        <p>
            The <i>Remaining item</i> can be used to replace the ingredient with 
            another item rather than removing it upon crafting. For instance,
            you can choose a bucket as the remaining item of a lava bucket
            ingredient. When the result item is crafted, the lava bucket will be 
            replaced with an empty bucket rather than disappearing entirely.<br>
            The currently selected remaining item is displayed around the bottom-right
            of the page ("Currently none" in the screenshot above).<br>
            <b>Note: the Remaining item is basically a <i>result</i>, so when you click on the Change button,
            you can configure it in the <a href="choose result.html">Choose result menu</a>.</b><br>
            Empty ingredients can <b>not</b> have a remaining item.<br>
        </p>
        <h3>Constraints</h3>
        <p>
            The <i>Constraints</i> can be used to add extra requirements to the ingredient. For instance,
            you can require the ingredient to have enough remaining durability or require it to have a
            specific enchantment. Constraints are most useful for tools. Click the <i>Constraints...</i>
            button to start configuring them.
