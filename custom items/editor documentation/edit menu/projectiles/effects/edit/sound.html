        <p>
            The play sound effect edit menu can be used to edit or create a 
            projectile effect that will play a minecraft sound with a given 
            pitch and volume. It should look like this:
        </p>
        <img src="sound.png" width="50%" />
        <ul>
            <li>
                Clicking the <i>Cancel</i> button will take you back to the menu 
                you came from, without adding a new sound projectile effect (if you
                were creating a new projectile effect) and without keeping any changes 
                you made here (if you were editing an existing effect).
            </li>
            <li>
                If you are creating a new sound projectile effect, clicking the 
                <i>Create</i> button will add the effect and then take you back to 
                the menu you came from.
            </li>
            <li>
                If you are editing an existing sound projectile effect, clicking the 
                <i>Apply</i> button will take you back to the menu you came from, and 
                keep the changes you made here.
            </li>
            <li>
                I don't really know how the volume and pitch work, but 1.0 and 1.0
                appear to be good default values. You will have to experiment if 
                you want to know more.
            </li>
            <li>
                Click the button on the right of <i>Sound:</i> to choose which 
                sound to play. The text on the button indicates the currently
                selected sound.
            </li>
        </ul>
