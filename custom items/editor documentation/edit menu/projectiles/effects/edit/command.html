        <p>
            The command effect edit menu can be used to add a new command projectile effect or modify an existing one.
            It should look like this:
        </p>
        <img src="command.png" width="50%" />
        <p>
            There is a 'Cancel' button, a 'Create' or 'Apply' button, an edit field for the command and a button to
            choose who will execute the command.
        </p>
        <ul>
            <li>
                The 'Cancel' button will take you back to the <a href="../overview.html">effects overview</a> you came
                from <b>without</b> keeping any changes or adding the new effect to the list.
            </li>
            <li>
                If you are editing an existing command effect, there will be an 'Apply' button which will take
                you back to the <a href="../overview.html">effects overview</a> you came from while keeping all changes
                you made in this menu.
            </li>
            <li>
                If you are adding a new command effect, there will be a 'Create' button which will take
                you back to the <a href="../overview.html">effects overview</a> you came from and add this new command
                effect to the effect list.
            </li>
            <li>
                The long edit field on the right of 'Command:' is where you are supposed to insert the command you 
                would like to be executed each time the effect is being performed. To make the command execution a 
                little more flexible, there are a couple of 'substitutions' that will occur right before the actual
                execution of the command:
                <ul>
                    <li>
                        Every occurence of <b>%x%</b> will be replaced by the x-coordinate of the projectile.
                        This will most likely <b>not</b> be an integer.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        Every occurence of <b>%y%</b> will be replaced by the y-coordinate of the projectile.
                        This will most likely <b>not</b> be an integer.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        Every occurence of <b>%z%</b> will be replaced by the z-coordinate of the projectile.
                        This will most likely <b>not</b> be an integer.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        Every occurence of <b>%bx%</b> will be replaced by the x-coordinate of the projectile 
                        rounded down. This could be useful for block operations that require integers.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        Every occurence of <b>%by%</b> will be replaced by the y-coordinate of the projectile 
                        rounded down. This could be useful for block operations that require integers.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        Every occurence of <b>%bz%</b> will be replaced by the z-coordinate of the projectile 
                        rounded down. This could be useful for block operations that require integers.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        Every occurence of <b>%caster%</b> will be replaced by the name of the player who 
                        fired the projectile.
                    </li>
                </ul>
            </li>
            <li>
                <p>
                    The button on the right of 'Executed by:' can be used to decide by who the command will be
                    executed. The text of the button shows who is currently configured to execute the command,
                    which is SHOOTER by default. You can change this by clicking on the button, which should 
                    take you to a small menu where you can choose the executor of the command.
                </p>
                <p>
                    The executor must be either the shooter of the projectile or the console. If you use the 
                    shooter, <b>you need to make sure that all players have the right permissions to execute 
                    the command</b>. If you choose the console, you might want to change the gamerules to 
                    disable the 'spam' in the console.
                </p>

        </ul>
