        <p>
            The push/pull projectile effect menu can be used to create or edit 
            push/pull projectile effects. These projectile effects will cause 
            entities that are close to the projectile to be pulled towards it or
            pushed away from it (depending on how you configure it). The menu 
            should look like this:
        </p>
        <img src="push.png" width="50%" />
        <ul>
            <li>
                Clicking the <i>Cancel</i> button will take you back to the menu you 
                came from, without keeping any changes made in this menu and without 
                adding a new push/pull projectile effect.
            </li>
            <li>
                If you are adding a new push/pull effect, there will be a <i>Create</i>
                button. Clicking it will add a new push/pull effect ot the projectile 
                with the configuration you made here.
            </li>
            <li>
                If you are editing an existing push/pull effect, there will be an 
                <i>Apply</i> button. Clicking it will take you back to the menu you 
                came from and keep all the changes you made here.
            </li>
            <li>
                The <i>Push strength</i> determines how hard nearby entities will 
                be pushed or pulled, and whether nearby entities will be pushed 
                or pulled. If it is positive, entities close to the projectile 
                will be pushed away from it. The amount determines how hard the 
                push will be. If this amount is 0.3, a velocity of magnitude 0.3
                meters/tick (which is 6 meters per second) away from the projectile 
                will be added to the velocity of all nearby entities. If the amount 
                is negative, it will determine how hard nearby entities will be 
                pulled towards the projectile. If the amount is -0.3, a velocity of
                magnitude 0.3 towards the projectile will be added to the velocity of 
                all nearby entities.
            </li>
            <li>
                The <i>Radius</i> determines how close entities need to be to the 
                projectile in order to get pushed or pulled. If it is 2.0, only 
                entities that are at most 2.0 meters (blocks) away from the projectile 
                will be pushed or pulled.
            </li>
        </ul>
