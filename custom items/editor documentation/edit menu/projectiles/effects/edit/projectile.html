        <p>
            The subprojectile effect edit menu can be used to add a subprojectile effect or to reconfigure
            an existing one. Subprojectile effects will cause the projectile to spawn another projectile at
            its location. The menu should look like this:
        </p>
        <img src="projectile.png" width="50%" />
        <p>
            There should be a 'Cancel' button and an 'Apply' or 'Create' button.
            Also, there should be a checkbox for the lifetime, an edit field for the minimum/maximum amount, 
            the angle to the parent and a button to choose the child projectile.
        </p>
        <ul>
            <li>
                The 'Cancel' button will take you back to the <a href="../overview.html">effects overview</a> you came
                from <b>without</b> keeping any changes or adding the new effect to the list.
            </li>
            <li>
                If you are editing an existing subprojectile effect, there will be an 'Apply' button which will take
                you back to the <a href="../overview.html">effects overview</a> you came from while keeping all changes
                you made in this menu.
            </li>
            <li>
                If you are adding a new subprojectile effect, there will be a 'Create' button which will take
                you back to the <a href="../overview.html">effects overview</a> you came from and add this new command
                effect to the effect list.
            </li>
            <li>
                The 'Use parent lifetime' checkbox determines whether the subprojectile should get its own lifetime or 
                share its lifetime with the 'parent' projectile that spawned it. <br>
                The 'lifetime' of a projectile is the maximum time it can fly before despawning: If a projectile hasn't 
                hit anything before its lifetime expires, it will despawn.<br>
                <ul>
                    <li>
                        If you keep this checkbox unchecked, the subprojectile will get the same lifetime as it would have
                        if it were directly launched by a player. In most of the cases, this is what you will want.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        <p>
                            If you check this checkbox, the lifetime of the subprojectile will be the <b>remaining</b> lifetime 
                            of the 'parent' projectile that launched it. So if the parent projectile fires the subprojectile when
                            the parent almost expires, the subprojectile will have a short lifetime.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            This is usually not what you want, but this is very useful when the subprojectile is the 'same' custom 
                            projectile as the parent (so for instance when a custom fireball with a lifetime of 20 seconds would fire 
                            another custom fireball as subprojectile after 8 seconds have passed). 
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            If in that scenario you didn't check this checkbox, the parent fireball would fire 
                            another fireball as subprojectile after 8 seconds which in turn would spawn yet another fireball after 
                            8 more seconds passed, which would also spawn yet another fireball...
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            But if you did check this checkbox, the second fireball will be spawned with the remaining lifetime of
                            the first fireball, namely 12 (= 20 - 8) seconds. 8 seconds later, it will spawn the third fireball, which 
                            will only have a lifetime of 4 (= 12 - 8) seconds. That one will <b>not</b> spawn a fourth fireball because
                            the third fireball will have been expired before it reaches the 8 seconds since it only has 4 seconds lifetime.
                        </p>
                    </li>
                </ul>
            </li>
            <li>
                The amount determines how many subprojectile will be spawned each time this effect is performed.
                It will be a randomly generated number between Minimum amount and Maximum amount.
                If the Angle to parent is not 0 or 180, each subprojectile should be launched in a different direction.
            </li>
            <li>
                The Angle to parent determines the angle between the direction the parent projectile is flying and the 
                direction in which the child projectile(s) will be launched.
                <ul>
                    <li>
                        If this angle is 0, the child projectile will fly in the same direction as the parent projectile.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        If this angle is 180, the child projectile will be launched in the opposite direction of the parent 
                        projectile, so it would fly back towards the shooter of the parent projectile.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        <p>
                            If this angle is another number, there are multiple possible directions in which the child projectile 
                            can be launched, and one of those directions will be picked randomly each time a child projectile is 
                            launched. 
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            To illustrate why there are multiple directions, consider the scenario where the parent 
                            projectile is flying vertically (upwards, towards the sky) and the Angle to parent is 90 degrees.
                            The direction of the child projectile must then be horizontally to make an angle of 90 degrees with 
                            the vertical direction of the parent. However, any horizontal direction is allowed. For instance, it
                            could fly towards the north, east, south and west (or north-east, or south-west...)
                            since they are all horizontal.
                        </p>
                    </li>
                </ul>
            </li>
            <li>
                The Child projectile determines which type of custom projectile will be launched when this effect is performed.
                The Child projectile must also be a custom projectile.
                It is allowed to use the 'same' projectile as child projectile, but you can only do this when you are editing an 
                existing projectile, not when you are creating a new one (because of mostly technical reasons).
