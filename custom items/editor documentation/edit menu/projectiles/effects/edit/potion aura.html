            The potion aura edit menu can be used to create or edit potion aura
            projectile effects. These are projectile effects that will give potion 
            effects to all entities that are close to the projectile. This menu 
            should look like this:
        </p>
        <img src="potion aura.png" width="50%" />
        <ul>
            <li>
                Clicking the <i>Cancel</i> button will take you back to the menu you 
                came from, without keeping any changes made in this menu and without 
                adding a new potion aura projectile effect.
            </li>
            <li>
                If you are adding a new potion aura effect, there will be a <i>Create</i>
                button. Clicking it will add a new potion aura effect ot the projectile 
                with the configuration you made here.
            </li>
            <li>
                If you are editing an existing potion aura effect, there will be an 
                <i>Apply</i> button. Clicking it will take you back to the menu you 
                came from and keep all the changes you made here.
            </li>
            <li>
                The <i>Radius</i> determines how close entities need to be to the 
                projectile to get the potion effects. If the radius is 2.0, the 
                potion effects will only be given to entities that are less than 
                2.0 meters (blocks) away from the projectile. Also, the duration or
                power of the potion effects will depend on <i>how</i> close entities 
                are to the projectile. (For instant effects, the power is affected.
                For all other potion effects, the duration is affected.) If the 
                radius is 2.0, entities that are 1.9 blocks away will get a very 
                short duration, entities that are 1.0 blocks away will get half the 
                duration of the potion effects, and entities extremely close to the 
                projectile will get the full duration.
            </li>
        </ul>
        <p>
            The right side of the page can be used to configure the actual potion 
            effects. You need to select at least 1 potion effect, but you can 
            select as many effects as you want. Each potion effect is represented
            by a single row. In every row, you can select the potion effect type,
            the duration (in ticks), and the level of the effect. Click the green <b>+</b> button 
            to add a new effect. Click the red <b>X</b> on the right of a row to
            remove that row (and the corresponding potion effect).
