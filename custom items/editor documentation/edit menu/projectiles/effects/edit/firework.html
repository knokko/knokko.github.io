        <p>
            The firework projectile effect menu can be used to edit or create 
            firework projectile effects. These projectile effects will create
            fireworks at the position of the projectile. The menu should look
            like this:
        </p>
        <img src="firework.png" width="50%" />
        <ul>
            <li>
                Clicking the <i>Cancel</i> button will take you back to the menu 
                you came from, without adding a new firework projectile effect (if you
                were creating a new projectile effect) and without keeping any changes 
                you made here (if you were editing an existing effect).
            </li>
            <li>
                If you are creating a new firework projectile effect, clicking the 
                <i>Create</i> button will add the effect and then take you back to 
                the menu you came from.
            </li>
            <li>
                If you are editing an existing firework projectile effect, clicking the 
                <i>Apply</i> button will take you back to the menu you came from, and 
                keep the changes you made here.
            </li>
        </ul>
        <p>
            The right side of the page is used to configure the firework effects.
            You need at least 1 firework effect, but you can add many more if you 
            want. If you make more, they will all be displayed at the same time.
            Every firework effect is represented by an 'orange' box (in the 
            example above, there is only 1). You can add more by clicking the big 
            green <b>+</b> button. You can remove boxes/firework effects by 
            clicking their <b>X</b> button on the right. Every firework effect 
            has the following properties:
        </p>
        <ul>
            <li>
                <i>Flicker</i>: whether the firework effect should have the 
                flicker/twinkle effect.
            </li>
            <li>
                <i>Trail</i>: whether the firework effect should have the trail 
                effect.
            </li>
            <li>
                <i>Type</i>: the type/shape of the firework effect. Click on the 
                button on the right of <i>Type:</i> to change it. The text on the 
                button shows the currently selected type.
            </li>
            <li>
                <i>Colors</i>: the colors that the firework effect will show right 
                after the explosion. All these colors will be shown at the same time.
                Use the green <b>+</b> button to add colors. Every color consists of
                a red, green, and blue value. Each of these values must be at least 
                0 and at most 255. The higher the red value, the more 'red' the 
                firework effect will be. The same holds for green and blue. For 
                instance (Red=255, Green=0, Blue=0) denotes the color red and 
                (Red=255, Green=0, Blue=200) denotes the color pink. (Because
                pink is a combination of red and blue.) You can use a site like
                <a href="https://www.w3schools.com/colors/colors_rgb.asp">this</a>
                to easily design colors.
            </li>
            <li>
                <i>Fade colors</i>: the colors that the firework effect will show 
                a while after the explosion. All the fade colors will be shown at 
                the same time, but they will be shown after the regular colors 
                are (mostly) gone. The configuration of fade colors is similar to
                the configuration of regular colors.
