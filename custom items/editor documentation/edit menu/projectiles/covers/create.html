        <p>
            The projectile cover creation menu can be used to create a new projectile cover.
            In this menu, you need to choose what type of projectile cover you would like to add.
            This menu should look like this:
        </p>
        <img src="create.png" width="50%" />
        <p>
            There should be a 'Cancel' button and a button for each type of projectile cover, which are currently
            only 'Sphere' and 'Custom'.
            The 'Cancel' button will take you back to the <a href="overview.html">projectile cover overview</a>,
            without adding a new projectile cover. The other buttons will take you to the edit menu for the 
            corresponding projectile cover type. I will describe them briefly:
        </p>
        <ul>
            <li>
                The 'Sphere' button is for making sphere-shaped projectile covers. 
                These kind of projectile covers have a shape that looks like a sphere and will be drawn around the 
                custom projectile in-game, which will cause the custom projectile to look like a sphere.
                You will be able to make the texture of the sphere.
                The corresponding edit menu is the <a href="edit/sphere.html">sphere projectile cover edit menu</a>.
            </li>
            <li>
                The 'Custom' button is for making custom projectile covers.
                A custom projectile cover only has an item model and a texture, which you will have to make.
                The model will slowly rotate around the custom projectile in-game.
                The corresponding edit menu is the <a href="edit/custom.html">custom projectile cover edit menu</a>.
            </li>
        </ul>
