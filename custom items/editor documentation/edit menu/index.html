        <p>
            The item set edit menu is the root menu from which you can edit, save and export an item set.
            It should look like this:
        </p>
        <img src="edit menu.png" width="50%" />
        <p>
            The menu consist of the save-related buttons on the left and the edit buttons on the right.
            Also, there is the red 'Quit' button, which quits editing <b>without</b> saving the changes.
        </p>
        <p>
            The 'Save' button will save the changes made to the item set and create a back-up 
            (see <a href="../main menu/edit/backup.html">the back-up selection menu</a>) and should display 'Saved successfully'
            once the saving is finished.
            The 'Save and quit' button will do everything the 'Save' button does, but also go back to the 
            <a href="../main menu/index.html">main menu</a>.
            Then there are several Export buttons: one for each minecraft version supported by this plug-in.
            Clicking on any of the Export buttons will do everything the 'Save and quit' button does, but <a href="../../exporting.html">more</a>.
        </p>
        <p>
            Then there are the buttons for editing the item set.
        </p>
