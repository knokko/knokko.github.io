            The sound type edit menu can be used to edit or create custom sound types. A custom sound type is
            basically a .ogg file with some associated information. This menu should look like this:
        </p>
        <img src="edit type.png" width="50%" />
        <h2>Name</h2>
        <p>
            The name of the sound type, which will be used in the resource pack. Therefor, it has rather strict
            naming rules (it can only include lowercase characters, underscores, and digits). You can plan the
            sound in-game using the /playsound command using kci_<b>name</b>.
        </p>
        <h2>Sound file</h2>
        <p>
            The file that contains the actual sound (or music track) that you want to play. Only the .ogg sound file
            format is supported.
        </p>
        <h2>Category</h2>
        <p>
            The category of the sound type, which determines which volume slider players need to use to change the
            volume of the sound. Every category belongs to 1 of these volume sliders:
