        <p>
            The combined resourcepack edit menu can be used to add or modify <i>combined resourcepacks</i>. Combined
            resourcepacks are other (typically third-party) resourcepacks that will automatically be combined
            with the resourcepack generated by the Editor. This is convenient because minecraft servers can only
            have 1 server resource pack. A couple of example usecases are:
        </p>
        <ul>
            <li>
                Combine with a simple decorative resourcepack that changes the textures of vanilla minecraft items.
                This will result in a resourcepack that adds custom items <b>and</b> retextures vanilla items.
            </li>
            <li>
                Combine with a resourcepack required by another plug-in. This makes it possible to use multiple
                plug-ins that add custom items. This can work well with specialized custom item plug-ins that
                only touch a couple of item models, but is unlikely to work well alongside other general-purpose
                custom item plug-ins.
            </li>
            <li>
                Combine with a (self-made) resourcepack that adds functionality to this plug-in that is not yet
                supported by this plug-in. Note: this is for advanced users only and can easily break the
                resourcepack. (In the past, advanced users needed to manually alter the exported resourcepack
                every single time they exported it.)
            </li>
        </ul>
        This menu should look like this:<br>
        <img src="edit.png" width="50%" />
        <h3>Name</h3>
        <p>
            When you have multiple combined resourcepacks, the <i>Name</i>s are very convenient to distinguish
            them from each other. Other than that, they serve no purpose at the moment.
        </p>
        <h3>Priority</h3>
        <p>
            The <i>Priority</i> determines what happens when the combined resourcepack <i>conflicts</i> with the
            Editor resourcepack or with another combined resourcepack. A <i>conflict</i> occurs when two
            resourcepacks contain the same file (e.g. multiple resourcepacks contain the file <b>diamond_sword.json</b>).
            When a conflict occurs, the file of the resourcepack with the <b>highest</b> priority will be used,
            and the other conflicting files will be ignored. The Editor resourcepack has a priority of 0 and all
            resourcepacks must have a distinct priority.
        </p>
        <h4>Recommendation</h4>
        <p>
            Whenever possible, use a priority below 0. When you use a priority above zero, the combined resourcepack
            can overwrite files of the Editor resourcepack, which can easily break the custom texture system. Priorities
            above 0 are mostly useful for advanced users that really know what they are doing.
        </p>
        <h3>Choose file...</h3>
        <p>
            Click this button to select the actual resourcepack that is to be combined.
