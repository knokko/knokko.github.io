        <p>
            The energy type edit menu can be used to create a new <i>energy type</i> or to modify an existing
            energy type. Container recipes may require or generate energy of a certain energy type. This menu should
            look like this:
        </p>
        <img src="edit.png" width="50%" />
        <h2>Name</h2>
        <p>
            The name of the energy type is <b>not</b> used in-game: it only helps you distinguishing energy types from
            each other.
        </p>
        <h2>Values</h2>
        <p>
            At any point in time, a custom container has a certain amount/<i>value</i> of the energy type. This value
            is always an integer and it will be between the <i>Minimum value</i> and the <i>Maximum value</i> that you
            specify here. The first time a custom container is opened, the value will be the <i>Initial value</i>
            that you specify here.
        </p>
        <h2>Sharing an energy type</h2>
        <p>
            The 'sharing' checkboxes determine whether energy of this energy type will be shared between containers.
            By default, all checkboxes are <b>un</b>checked, which will cause the energy to be shared between containers
            if and only if the containers share their inventory. (Containers of the same type can share their inventory if
            their <i>storage mode</i> allows it.)
        </p>
        <h3>Share with other container types</h3>
        <p>
            This determines what happens when 2 different custom containers are at the same location. If you leave this
            <b>unchecked</b>, each container will have its <b>own</b> energy stash, so when one of the containers drains
            energy, the other will <b>not</b> notice it. If you <b>check</b> this, containers at the same location will
            share their energy. (So when a recipe of one container generates energy, a recipe of another container can
            consume it.)
        </p>
        <h3>Force sharing with other locations</h3>
        <p>
            If you leave this <b>un</b>checked, containers at different locations will only share their energy if they
            share their inventory (when their storage mode is <b>per player</b> or <b>global</b>). If you <b>check</b>
            this checkbox, containers at different locations will share their energy, even when their storage mode is
            <b>per location</b>.
        </p>
        <h3>Force sharing with other string hosts</h3>
        <p>
            If you leave this <b>un</b>checked, containers at different string hosts will only share their energy if they
            share their inventory (when their storage mode is <b>per player</b> or <b>global</b>). If you <b>check</b>
            this checkbox, containers at different string hosts will share their energy, even when their storage mode is
            <b>per location</b>.
        </p>
        <h3>Force sharing with other players</h3>
        <p>
            If you leave this <b>un</b>checked, players will share the energy of custom containers with other players if
            and only if they share the inventory of that custom container with other players (so when the storage mode
            is <b>global</b> or <b>per location</b>). If you <b>check</b> this, players will also share the energy of 
            custom containers when they do <b>not</b> share their inventory (when the storage mode is <b>per player</b>
            or <b>per location per player</b>).
