            The slot display creation menu can be used to create/choose a 'slot display'. A slot display 
            consists of a display name, lore and a vanilla item or custom item. A slot display is much like
            the name suggests: it is an in-game item that can't be picked up, but will be used to decorate
            a slot in the inventory/menu of the custom container. This menu should look like this:
        </p>
        <img src="display.png" width="50%" />
        <ul>
            <li>
                The 'Cancel' button will take you back to the menu you came from (this menu is used by a 
                lot of other menus) without choosing a slot display.
            </li>
            <li>
                The 'Done' button will try to complete the creation and selection of the slot display.
                If it succeeds, it will also take you back to the menu you came from.
            </li>
        </ul>
