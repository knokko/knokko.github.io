        <p>
            The storage slot menu can be used to configure a storage slot of a 
            custom container. Currently, only the <i>placeholder</i> can be
            configured. This menu should look like this:
        </p>
        <img src="storage.png" width="50%" />
        <ul>
            <li>
                The 'Cancel' button will take you back to the <a href="../edit.html">container edit menu</a>
                you came from, without adding a new storage slot.
            </li>
            <li>
                The 'Done' button will replace the original slot with a new storage 
                slot with the optional placeholder you chose. It will then take you 
                back to the <a href="../edit.html">container edit menu</a> you came 
                from.
            </li>
            <li>
                The <i>Change...</i> button on the right of <i>Place holder:</i>
                can be used to choose the <i>place holder</i> of the new storage 
                slot. The place holder will be shown to players whenever the 
                slot is empty. <b>Note that this is optional: if you don't 
                choose a place holder, players will simply see an empty slot 
                when the storage slot is empty.</b> (Which is usually what you want.)
            </li>
        </ul>
