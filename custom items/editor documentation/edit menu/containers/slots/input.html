            The input slot menu can be used to add input slots to a custom container. Input slots are the slots
            in which players need to put the ingredients for the <i>recipes</i> of the container. Input slots 
            have a <i>name</i> and a <i>placeholder</i>. The menu should look like this:
        </p>
        <img src="input.png" width="50%" />
        <ul>
            <li>
                The 'Cancel' button will take you back to the <a href="../edit.html">container edit menu</a>
                you came from, without adding a new input slot.
            </li>
            <li>
                The 'Done' button will replace the original slot with a new input slot with the name you 
                typed into the edit field (if no validation errors occur). It will then take you back to the 
                <a href="../edit.html">container edit menu</a> you came from.
            </li>
            <li>
                You should type the <i>name</i> of the input slot you're about to create in the edit field 
                on the right of 'Name:'. No two input slots of the same custom container can have the same
                name. The name will not be used in-game, but it will be used to link the inputs of the 
                container recipes to the input slots. So to move an input slot, you would delete it and 
                create a new input slot with the same name somewhere else.
            </li>
            <li>
                The <i>Placeholder</i> will be displayed in the slot when no ingredient is currently in the slot. 
                Click the <i>Choose...</i> button to choose the placeholder and click the <i>Clear...</i> button to remove it.
                <b>Note: the placeholder is optional!</b>
            </li>
        </ul>
