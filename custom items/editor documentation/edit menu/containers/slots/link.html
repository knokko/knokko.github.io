            The link slot menu can be used to create link slots for a custom container. Every link slot has a
            <i>target container</i>. Whenever a player clicks on a link slot, he will close his current custom container
            and open the target container. This menu should look like this:
        </p>
        <img src="link.png" width="50%" />
        <h3>Container</h3>
        <p>
            The <i>Target container</i>: when a player clicks on this slot, he will open that container. <b>Note:
            if the target container requires permission, the player will need that permission. Also, the target
            container must have the same <i>host</i> as this container.</b>
        </p>
        <h3>Display</h3>
        <p>
            The <i>Display</i> determines what this slot will look like. If you don't choose a display, it will look like
            en empty slot.
