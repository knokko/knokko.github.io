        <p>
            The fuel indicator menu can be used to create a new fuel indicator slot. Fuel indicator slots
            are linked to a fuel slot and show if that fuel slot is burning and for how long. Fuel
            indicator slots have an associated fuel slot, a display item, a placeholder item and an
            indicator domain. The display item will be shown when the associated fuel slot is burning and
            the placeholder item when it's not. The indicator domain is interesting when using multiple
            fuel indicators for a single fuel slot. This menu should look like this:
        </p>
        <img src="fuel indicator.png" width="50%" />
        <ul>
            <li>
                The 'Cancel' button will take you back to the <a href="../edit.html">contaier edit menu</a>
                without creating a new fuel indicator slot and without replacing the original slot.
            </li>
            <li>
                The 'Done' button will replace the original slot (the slot you clicked before going to the 
                previous menu) with the new fuel indicator slot you are designing here (at least if no 
                validation errors are found). It will then take you back to the 
                <a href="../edit.html">contaier edit menu</a>.
            </li>
            <li>
                The button on the right of 'Fuel slot:' shows the currently selected fuel slot (the fuel 
                slot for which you are going to create an indiator). To choose a fuel slot, you need to
                click the button and then on the fuel slot you would like to choose. <i>Note: you need to
                    have at least 1 fuel slot, or you won't have anything to choose. So create the fuel 
                    slot <b>before</b> creating its indicator!
                </i>
            </li>
            <li>
                The 'Display...' button lets you choose which item to display when the fuel slot is burning.
                It will take you to the <a href="display.html">slot display creation menu</a>, where you can 
                configure this item.
            </li>
            <li>
                The 'Placeholder...' button lets you choose which item to display when the fuel slot isn't
                burning. It will take you to the <a href="display.html">slot display creation menu</a>, 
                where you can configure this item.
            </li>
            <li>
                The indication domain can be used to let the fuel indicator 'zoom in' on a part of the 
                burning time of the fuel slot. 
                <ul>
                    <li>
                        If you leave it at 0% to 100%, the display item will have a stacksize of 64 when the 
                        fuel slot starts burning, gradually decrease, hit a stacksize of 1 when the fuel slot 
                        almost stops burning, and turns into the placeholder when it stops burning completely.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        If you would change it to 50% to 100%, the stacksize would decrease twice as fast and
                        the display item would be replaced with the placeholder item as soon as less than 50%
                        of the burn time remains.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        If you would change it to 0% to 100%, the stacksize would say 64 until half of the burn 
                        time has passed, but then also decrease twice as fast.
                    </li>
                </ul>
                The latter two may seem stupid, but they can be useful if you use them both and place them in 
                slots next to each other: that would basically give an indicator that is twice as accurate as 
                the basic 0% to 100%.
            </li>
        </ul>
