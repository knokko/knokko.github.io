            The crafting progress indicator menu can be used to create a new crafting progress indicator 
            slot. Crafting progress indicator slots indicate to players if the container is currently
            'smelting' input items, and how much time remains until the recipe is finished. These slots 
            have a display item, placeholder item and an indication domain. The display item will be
            shown to players when the container is busy with converting the inputs of a <i>recipe</i>
            to the outputs. The placeholder item will be shown when the container is idle. The 
            indication domain is interesting when using multiple crafting progress indicator slots. The 
            menu should look like this:
        </p>

        <ul>
            <li>
                The 'Cancel' button will take you back to the <a href="../edit.html">contaier edit menu</a>
                without creating a new crafting progress indicator slot and without replacing the original 
                slot.
            </li>
            <li>
                The 'Done' button will replace the original slot (the slot you clicked before going to the 
                previous menu) with the new crafting progress indicator slot you are designing here 
                (at least if no validation errors are found). It will then take you back to the 
                <a href="../edit.html">contaier edit menu</a>.
            </li>
            <li>
                The 'Display...' button lets you choose which item to display when the container is active.
                It will take you to the <a href="display.html">slot display creation menu</a>, where you can 
                configure this item.
            </li>
            <li>
                The 'Placeholder...' button lets you choose which item to display when the container is idle.
                It will take you to the <a href="display.html">slot display creation menu</a>, 
                where you can configure this item.
            </li>
            <li>
                The indication domain can be used to let the crafting progress indicator 'zoom in' on a part 
                of the crafting progress. 
                <ul>
                    <li>
                        If you leave it at 0% to 100%, the display item will have a stacksize of 1 when the 
                        custom container starts, gradually increase, hit a stacksize of 64 when the recipe is 
                        almost complete, and turns back into the placeholder when it is finished.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        If you would change it to 50% to 100%, the slot would keep displaying the placeholder 
                        item until the container is at 50% of the current recipe, but the stacksize will 
                        increase twice as fast, so it would still reach the 64 right before the recipe is 
                        complete.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        If you would change it to 0% to 50%, the display item will be shown as soon as the 
                        container starts with the recipe, but the stacksize will hit the 64 already when 
                        the container is at 50% of the current recipe, and then remain 64 until the recipe 
                        is complete.
                    </li>
                </ul>
                The latter two may seem stupid, but they can be useful if you use them both and place them in 
                slots next to each other: that would basically give an indicator that is twice as accurate as 
                the basic 0% to 100%.
            </li>
        </ul>
