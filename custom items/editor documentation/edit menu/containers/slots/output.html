        <p>
            The output slot menu can be used to add output slots to a custom container. Output slots are the 
            slots in which the resulting items of container recipes appear when the inputs have been 
            converted. Output slots don't have any properties, except for its name. The menu should look like 
            this:
        </p>
        <img src="output.png" width="50%" />
        <ul>
            <li>
                The 'Cancel' button will take you back to the <a href="../edit.html">container edit menu</a>
                you came from, without adding a new output slot.
            </li>
            <li>
                The 'Done' button will replace the original slot with a new output slot with the name you 
                typed into the edit field (if no validation errors occur). It will then take you back to the 
                <a href="../edit.html">container edit menu</a> you came from.
            </li>
            <li>
                You should type the <i>name</i> of the output slot you're about to create in the edit field 
                on the right of 'Name:'. No two output slots of the same custom container can have the same
                name. The name will not be used in-game, but it will be used to link the outputs of the 
                container recipes to the output slots. So to move an output slot, you would delete it and 
                create a new output slot with the same name somewhere else.
            </li>
        </ul>
