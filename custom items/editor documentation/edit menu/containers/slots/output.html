            The output slot menu can be used to add output slots to a custom container. Output slots are the 
            slots in which the resulting items of container recipes appear when the inputs have been 
            converted. (It works similarly to the output slot of a furnace.) Output slots are relatively simple and
            only have a <i>name</i> and a <i>placeholder</i>.
        </p>

        <ul>
            <li>
                The 'Cancel' button will take you back to the <a href="../edit.html">container edit menu</a>
                you came from, without adding a new output slot.
            </li>
            <li>
                The 'Done' button will replace the original slot with a new output slot with the name you 
                typed into the edit field (if no validation errors occur). It will then take you back to the 
                <a href="../edit.html">container edit menu</a> you came from.
            </li>
            <li>
                You should type the <i>name</i> of the output slot you're about to create in the edit field 
                on the right of 'Name:'. No two output slots of the same custom container can have the same
                name. The name will not be used in-game, but it will be used to link the outputs of the 
                container recipes to the output slots. So to move an output slot, you would delete it and 
                create a new output slot with the same name somewhere else.
            </li>
            <li>
                The <i>Placeholder</i> will be displayed in the slot when no output is currently in the slot. 
                Click the <i>Choose...</i> button to choose the placeholder and click the <i>Clear...</i> button to remove it.
                <b>Note: the placeholder is optional!</b>
            </li>
        </ul>
