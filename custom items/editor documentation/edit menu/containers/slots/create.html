        <p>
            The slot creation menu can be used to create a new slot for a given custom container and put
            it in its slot grid. Slots play a very important role in custom containers because custom containers 
            are not much more than a chest-like inventory menu where each inventory slot represents a slot of
            the custom container. There are a couple of different types of slots, currently 7. Every type of 
            slot has its own button in this menu, which looks like this:
        </p>
        <img src="create.png" width="50%" />
        <ul>
            <li>
                The 'Cancel' button is the only button in this menu that does <b>not</b> correspond to a slot 
                type. Clicking it will take you back to the <a href="../edit.html">container edit menu</a>
                you came from.
            </li>
            <li>
                The 'Decoration' button will take you to the <a href="display.html">slot display creation menu</a>. 
                Decoration slots are slots that will contain an item of your choice, but the players won't be
                able to take the item from the slot or put another item in it. As the name implies, it is simply
                a decoration for the container. If almost all slots are decorations, it is clear for players that
                the remaining slots <i>are</i> usable (if all slots except the inputs and outputs are filled with 
                for instance black glass panes, the input and output slots are the only empty slots, which makes
                it easy for players to understand).
            </li>
            <li>
                The 'Empty' button will make the slot empty (again). Empty slots do not contain an item and 
                players can <b>not</b> put items in them. Empty slots are thus <i>always</i> empty. When 
                creating a new custom container, the slot grid is intially filled with such empty slots.
            </li>
            <li>
                The 'Fuel' button will take you to the <a href="fuel.html">fuel slot menu</a>. Fuel slots
                work very similarly to the fuel slot in a regular furnace: players can put item in it, 
                and the furnace will start burning if the item is valid fuel and there is an item ready
                to be turned in the input slot. Unlike furnaces, there can be multiple fuel slots (the 
                fuel mode of the container determines how this works exactly) and fuel slots can have
                a custom fuel registry (you can choose which items count as fuel, which items don't,
                and how long each item will burn before it is gone).
            </li>
            <li>
                The 'Fuel indicator' button will take you to the 
                <a href="fuel indicator.html">fuel indicator menu</a>. Fuel indicators are linked to a
                single fuel slot and have a dispay item and a placeholder item. When the corresponding
                fuel slot is burning, the display item will be shown in the slot. When the corresponding 
                fuel slot is not burning, the placeholder item will be shown in the slot. Also, the 
                stacksize will decrease as the remaining burn time counts down. Just like decoraiton 
                slots, players can't take items from fuel indicator slots or put items in them.
                <i>
                    Regular furnaces use the flame icon below the fuel slot to indicate how much burn 
                    time remains. Unfortunately, custom containers do not have this luxury
                    (an attempt was made to use regular furnaces for custom containers, but minecraf and 
                    bukkit didn't cooperate...), so you will have to use fuel indicators slots instead.
                </i>
            </li>
            <li>
                The 'Input' button will take you to the <a href="input.html">input slot menu</a>. Just like 
                regular furnaces, input slots are the slots where players put items they want to smelt. 
                But unlike furnaces, you can have multiple input slots.
                The <i>recipes</i> of the custom container you're editing determine which items are considered
                to be inputs for which slots. 
            </li>
            <li>
                The 'Output' button will take you to the <a href="output.html">output slot menu</a>. Just 
                like regular furnaces, output slots are the slots where the result items appear when an
                input item is converted. Players can take items from the output slots, but not put items 
                in them. Unlike regular furnaces, custom containers can have multiple output slots.
                The <i>recipes</i> of the container determine which items will appear in which output slots 
                for which input items.
            </li>
            <li>
                The 'Crafting progress indicator' button will take you to the 
                <a href="crafting progress indicator.html">crafting progress indicator menu</a>. These kind
                of slots are used to show the players how much time remains before the inputs of a recipe 
                will be converted to the outputs. In regular furnaces, this is accomplished by the arrow
                between the input slot and the output slot. <i>
                    Just like fuel indicators, custom containers don't have this luxury either, so an
                    alternative was needed, which are crafting progress indicator slots.
                </i> These slots have a placeholder item and a display item. The display item is shown when 
                inputs are currently being converted to outputs, and the placeholder item is shown when the 
                container is idle. Also, the stacksize of the display item will increase as the time until
                the inputs are converted decreases.
            </li>
            <li>
                The 'Storage' button will take you to <a href="storage.html">storage slot menu</a>. 
                Storage slots are slots that don't participate in container recipes,
                but players can use these slots to store any item they want. (So storage 
                slots are basically 'chest' slots.)
