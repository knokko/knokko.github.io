        <p>
            The energy indicator menu can be used to create a new energy indicator slot. Energy indicator slots
            show how much energy of a custom energy type is stored in its custom container. Energy
            indicator slots have an associated energy type, a display item, a placeholder item and an
            indicator domain. The display item will be shown when the amount of energy stored in the container is
            larger than the minimum value of the energy type and the placeholder item when it's not. 
            The indicator domain is interesting when using multiple energy indicator slots for a 
            single energy indicator. This menu should look like this:
        </p>
        <img src="energy indicator.png" width="50%" />
        <ul>
            <li>
                The 'Cancel' button will take you back to the <a href="../edit.html">container edit menu</a>
                without creating a new energy indicator slot and without replacing the original slot.
            </li>
            <li>
                The 'Done' button will replace the original slot (the slot you clicked before going to the 
                previous menu) with the new energy indicator slot you are designing here (at least if no 
                validation errors are found). It will then take you back to the 
                <a href="../edit.html">container edit menu</a>.
            </li>
            <li>
                The button on the right of 'Energy type:' shows the currently selected energy type (the energy 
                type for which you are going to create an indicator). To choose an energy type, you need to
                click the button and then on the energy type you would like to choose. <i>Note: you need to
                    have at least 1 energy type, or you won't have anything to choose. So create the energy 
                    type <b>before</b> creating its indicator!
                </i>
            </li>
            <li>
                The 'Display...' button lets you choose which item to display when the amount of energy
                stored is larger than the minimum value of the energy type.
                It will take you to the <a href="display.html">slot display creation menu</a>, where you can 
                configure this item.
            </li>
            <li>
                The 'Placeholder...' button lets you choose which item to display when the amount of energy
                stored is the minimum amount of the energy type. It will take you to the 
                <a href="display.html">slot display creation menu</a>, where you can configure this item.
            </li>
            <li>
                The indication domain can be used to let the energy indicator 'zoom in' on a part of the 
                domain of the energy type.
                <ul>
                    <li>
                        If you leave it at 0% to 100%, the display item will have a stacksize of 64 when the 
                        stored energy is the maximum value and a stacksize of 1 when the stored energy is just
                        above the minimum value of the energy type. When the stored energy is exactly the
                        minimum value, the placeholder will be shown.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        If you would change it to 50% to 100%, the display item would get a stacksize of 1 when
                        the stored energy is slightly above the average of the minimum and maximum value of the
                        energy type. The placeholder would be shown when the stored energy is less than or equal
                        to the average of the minimum value and the maximum value.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        If you would change it to 0% to 50%, the stacksize of the display item will be 64 if
                        the stored energy is larger than the average of the minimum and maximum value of the
                        energy type.
                    </li>
                </ul>
                The latter two may seem stupid, but they can be useful if you use them both and place them in 
                slots next to each other: that would basically give an indicator that is twice as accurate as 
                the basic 0% to 100%.
            </li>
        </ul>
