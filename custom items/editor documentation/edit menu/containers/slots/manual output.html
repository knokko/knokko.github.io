        <p>
            The manual output slot menu can be used to add manual output slots to a custom container. Manual output slots are the 
            slots in which the resulting items of container recipes appear will appear as soon as the inputs are placed. The inputs will
            be consumed when the player clicks on the manual output slot. (So it works like the result slot of a crafting table.)
            Just like regular output slots, manual output slots have only a <i>name</i> and a <i>placeholder</i>. It should look like this:
        </p>
        <img src="manual output.png" width="50%" />
        <ul>
            <li>
                The 'Cancel' button will take you back to the <a href="../edit.html">container edit menu</a>
                you came from, without adding a new manual output slot.
            </li>
            <li>
                The 'Done' button will replace the original slot with a new manual output slot with the provided name
                and placeholder. It will then take you back to the <a href="../edit.html">container edit menu</a> you came from.
            </li>
            <li>
                You should type the <i>name</i> of the manual output slot you're about to create in the edit field 
                on the right of 'Name:'. No two manual output slots of the same custom container can have the same
                name. The name will not be used in-game, but it will be used to link the manual outputs of the 
                container recipes to the manual output slots. So to move a manual output slot, you would delete it and 
                create a new manual output slot with the same name somewhere else.
            </li>
            <li>
                The <i>Placeholder</i> will be displayed in the slot when no manual container recipe is ready.
                (For instance when the player hasn't placed any ingredients yet.) Click the <i>Choose...</i> button
                to choose the placeholder and click the <i>Clear...</i> button to remove it.
                <b>Note: the placeholder is optional!</b>
            </li>
        </ul>
