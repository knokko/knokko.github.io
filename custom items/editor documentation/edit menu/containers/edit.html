    </head>
    <body>
        <p>
            The container edit menu can be used to create or modify custom containers. Custom containers are 
            basically custom versions of furnaces, but with many possibilities. The container will have
            a chest-like inventory menu. You will be the one who decides which purpose each of the slots will
            have (input, fuel, output, decoration, or indicator). Using fuel is optional and you can use any
            number of input and output slots. The <a href="slots/create.html">slot creation menu</a> has
            more detailed information about all types of slots. You will also need to give the container its
            own recipes. The recipes define which items should be in which input slots to produce which items 
            in which output slots, and how long it will take.
        </p>
        <p>
            If you just started creating a new (emtpy) custom container, it should look like this:
        </p>
        <img src="edit.png" width="50%" />
        <ul>
            <li>
                The 'Cancel' button will take you back to the <a href="overview.html">container overview</a>,
                without keeping any changes you made to this container. (If you are creating a new container,
                this will <b>not</b> add the container.)
            </li>
            <li>
                If you are creating a new container (like in the screenshot above), there will be a 'Create'
                button that will try to add the container you're making to the list of containers. If it
                succeeds, it will also take you back to the container overview.
            </li>
            <li>
                If you are modifying an existing container (unlike in the screenshot above), there will be
                an 'Apply' button. Clicking it will keep the changes you made to it (if there are no 
                validation errors) and then take you back to the container overview.
            </li>
            <li>
                In the text field on the right of 'Name:', you should insert a name for the container you're
                making. The name is used to identify the container, so no two containers can have the same name.
                The name of the container is currently not even used in the plug-in, so don't bother formatting.
            </li>
            <li>
                <p>
                    The <b>Host</b> block and <b>Selection icon</b> determine how players can open this
                    custom container. The Host can be a vanilla container, a vanilla block, a custom block, or nothing.
                    <ul>
                        <li>
                            If the host is a vanilla container, players can open the custom container by <b>left</b>-clicking 
                            the host block while sneaking.
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            If the host is a regular vanilla block or a custom block, players can open the custom container by 
                            <b>right</b>-clicking the host block (while <b>not</b> sneaking).
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            If there is no host, players can only open this custom container using an appropriate 
                            <a href="../items/edit/pocket container.html">pocket container</a>.
                        </li>
                    </ul>
                </p>
                <p>
                    If multiple custom containers have the same host block, interacting with the host block 
                    will instead take the player to a simple inventory menu where they can choose which 
                    container to open. The inventory menu will have an item stack for each of custom container 
                    with that host. The Selection icon will determine which item stack will represent
                    the custom container in that menu.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Also, the display name of the selection icon will be used as the title of the container 
                    inventory/menu, regardless of how many containers share the same host.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Click on the 'Change...' button on the right of 'Selection icon:' to choose a selection icon 
                    for this container. This will take you to the 
                    <a href="slots/display.html">slot display creation menu</a> where you can choose the (new)
                    selection icon.
                </p>
                <p>
                    The 'Change...' button on the right of 'Host: ...' will take you to the 
                    <a href="host.html">container host selection menu</a>, where you can choose a new host block for this custom container.
                </p>
            </li>
            <li>
                The fuel mode determines the fuel system of the container. There are currently 2 possible 
                options: <b>All</b> and <b>Any</b>. The button on the right of 'Fuel mode:' shows the 
                current fuel mode of the container. Click on the button to change it. When using the
                <b>All</b> fuel mode, all fuel slots of the container must be burning in order to use 
                any of the container recipes. When using the <b>Any</b> fuel mode, at least 1 of the fuel 
                slots must be burning in order to use any of the container recipes. Note:
                <ul>
                    <li>
                        When the container doesn't have any fuel slots, you should choose <b>All</b>. 
                        Because of first-order-logic reasons, 'all 0' fuel slots are considered to be burning if 
                        there are no fuel slots. But <b>Any</b> would be a bad choice because it is impossible
                        for players to get at least 1 fuel slot burning if there are no fuel slots at all.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        When the container has only 1 fuel slot, it doesn't matter which of the 2 
                        fuel modes you pick.
                    </li>
                </ul>
            </li>
            <li>
                The <i>Storage mode</i> determines what happens to the contents of the container when the player closes
                the container. There are 5 possible storage modes:
                <ul>
                    <li>
                        <b>NOT_PERSISTENT</b>: The contents will be dropped on the floor. This is similar to a crafting table.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        <b>PER_LOCATION_PER_PLAYER</b>: The contents will be stored at the location of the container. This
                        location is either a block, an item stack, or a <a href="string host.html">string host</a>. Players can only see
                        and take their <b>own</b> items.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        <b>PER_LOCATION</b>: The contents will be stored at the location of the container. This location is 
                        either a block, an item stack, or a <a href="string host.html">string host</a>. The items can be seen and taken by
                        any player that can access the same location. This is similar to a chest and a furnace.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        <b>PER_PLAYER</b>: The contents will be stored and can be accessed by the <b>same</b> player from
                        any <b>container of the same type</b>, regardless of the location. This is similar to an ender chest.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        <b>GLOBAL</b>: The contents will be stored and can be accessed by <b>any</b> player from any
                        <b>container of the same type</b>, regardless of the location.
                    </li>
                </ul>
            </li>
            <li>
                The 'Recipes...' button will take you to the 
                <a href="recipes/overview.html">container recipe overview</a> <b>for this container</b>. Every
                custom container has its own list of recipes! 
            </li>
        </ul>
        <p>
            Finally, there is the slot grid, which occupies most of the space in this menu. Every slot in this 
            menu represents a single slot in the inventory/menu of the custom container in-game. The number of
            columns will always be 9 (a minecraft inventory restriction) and the number of rows in-game will be
            equal to the number of rows in this menu (which you can control).
        </p>
        <ul>
            <li>
                Clicking on any of the slots will take you to the <a href="slots/create.html">slot creation menu</a>. 
                In there, you will be able to create a new slot, and the slot you clicked on will be replaced by that
                slot.
            </li>
            <li>
                Clicking on any of the green + buttons will insert a new empty row of slots at the vertical
                position of that button. (Clicking on the button on the top will insert a row on the top.)
            </li>
            <li>
                Clicking on any of the red X buttons will delete the row on the left of that button.
            </li>
            <li>
                Clicking on any of the /\ buttons will swap the row on its left with the row above it and
                clicking on any of the \/ buttons will swap the row on its left with the row below it.
            </li>
        </ul>
        <h3>Shortcuts</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>
                Press <b>c</b> while hovering your mouse over a slot to copy it.
            </li>
            <li>
                Press <b>p</b> while hovering your mouse over a slot to replace that slot by the slot you 
                last copied.
            </li>
        </ul>
        <h3>Errors</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>
                <b>There is already a container with name <i>X</i></b>: The item set you're currently working
                on already has a custom container with name <i>X</i>, and the text in the name field is also
                <i>X</i>. To fix this, type a different name in the edit field on the right of 'Name:'.
            </li>
            <li>
                <b>You need to choose a selection icon</b>: Every custom container must have a selection icon.
                If you get this error, you haven't chosen one yet. To do so, click on the 'Change...' button 
                on the right of 'Selection icon:'
            </li>
            <li>
                <b>The height must be a positive integer</b>: The height of the custom container is the number 
                of rows in the slot grid. Every custom container must have at least 1 row of slots, and this
                error will occur if you currently don't have any. To fix this, click on the green + button. 
            </li>
            <li>
                <b>The height can be at most 6</b>: The height of the custom container is the number 
                of rows in the slot grid. Because of minecraft restrictions, you can have at most 6 rows. 
                This error will occur if you have more than 6 rows. To fix this, remove rows until you 
                have only 6 rows left.
            </li>
            <li>
                <b>There are multiple fuel slots with name <i>X</i></b>: Every fuel slot in the grid must 
                have a distinct name. If you see this error, there are at least 2 fuel slots in the grid 
                that have the same name, namely <i>X</i>. To fix this, rename or remove fuel slots with 
                name <i>X</i> until there is only 1 fuel slot with name <i>X</i> left.
            </li>
            <li>
                <b>There are multiple input slots with name <i>X</i></b>: Every input slot in the grid must

                that have the same name, namely <i>X</i>. To fix this, rename or remove input slots with 
                name <i>X</i> until there is only 1 input slot with name <i>X</i> left.
            </li>
            <li>
                <b>There are multiple output slots with name <i>X</i></b>: Every output slot in the grid must 
                have a distinct name. If you see this error, there are at least 2 output slots in the grid 
                that have the same name, namely <i>X</i>. To fix this, rename or remove output slots with 
                name <i>X</i> until there is only 1 output slot with name <i>X</i> left.

                </b>: Every fuel indicator slot has a name and indicates the remaining burn time for the fuel 
                slot with that name. This error will occur if there is a fuel indicator slot with name <i>X</i>,
                but there is no fuel slot with name <i>X</i> (anymore). To fix this, either remove the fuel 
                slot indicator with name <i>X</i> or create a fuel slot with name <i>X</i>.
