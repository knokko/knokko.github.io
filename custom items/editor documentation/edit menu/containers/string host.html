        <h1>Container string hosts</h1>
        <h2>Container hosts</h2>
        <p>
            Custom containers always have a <i>host</i>. The player normally opens the custom container by interacting with
            the host. Furthermore, the contents of the container are usually stored at the host. The host is usually a block 
            or a pocket container. In the case of a block, the player can open it by right-clicking the block or by
            left-clicking it while sneaking. In the case of a pocket container, the player can open it by right-clicking
            with the pocket container in their hand.
        </p>
        <h2>String hosts</h2>
        <p>
            A special type of container hosts supported by this plug-in are <i>string hosts</i>. When using a string host,
            the container is associated with a string (basically a small piece of text in programming/scripting jargon)
            rather than with a block or pocket container. String hosts can only be used by the <b>/kci container</b> command,
            Skripts, and Denizen scripts. In combination with scripting, string hosts can be very powerful. However, they are
            not very useful without scripts.
        </p>
        <h3>Opening string hosts</h3>
        There are 3 ways to open a string host:
        <ul>
            <li>By using a command: /kci container open <b>container_name</b> <b>string_host</b> <i>player_name</i></li>
            <li>By using Skript: <b>player</b> opens kci "<b>container_name</b>" at "<b>string_host</b>"</li>
            <li>By using Denizen: kci_container <b>player</b> opens <b>container_name</b> at <b>string_host</b></li>
        </ul>
        In case you use the command, you need to have the right permissions. If you are opening the container
        <b>yourself</b>, you need at least 1 of the following permissions:
        <ul>
            <li>customitems.containercommand.openself.*.*</li>
            <li>customitems.containercommand.openself.<b>container_name</b>.*</li>
            <li>customitems.containercommand.openself.*.<b>string_host</b></li>
            <li>customitems.containercommand.openself.<b>container_name</b>.<b>string_host</b></li>
        </ul>
        If you use the command to let someone else open a custom container, you need to have the
        customitems.containercommand.openother permission.
        <h3>Choosing the container storage mode</h3>
        If you wish to use string hosts for a custom container, it is usually best to choose one of the following
        storage modes:
        <ul>
            <li>
                <b>NOT_PERSISTENT</b> if you want the container to drop all items when the player closes it. In this
                case, it doesn't really matter which string host you choose since no items can be stored.
            </li>
            <li>
                <b>PER_LOCATION</b> if you want the container to store its items at the string host and you want all
                players to share the same container inventory.
            </li>
            <li>
                <b>PER_LOCATION_PER_PLAYER</b> if you want the container to store its items at the string host and you
                want each player to have their own container inventory.
            </li>
        </ul>
        Using the other storage modes beats the purpose of string hosts because the container inventory will be shared
        between <b>distinct</b> string hosts.
        <h3>Choosing the string host</h3>
        <p>
            If you have chosen the <b>PER_LOCATION</b> or <b>PER_LOCATION_PER_PLAYER</b> storage mode, each distinct
            string host will have its own container inventory. If you have chosen another storage mode, all string hosts
            will share the same inventory (and thus it doesn't matter which string host you pick, so you can skip this
            section). Some examples of string hosts are given below:
        </p>
        <h4>Using 1 string host per container</h4>
        <p>
            If you use only 1 string host per container, it doesn't matter which string you choose. The result will
            basically be an 'ender custom container' that players can open via commands or scripts. You could use this
            for an extra ender chest or for some kind of 'wiki'.
        </p>
        <h4>Using faction names as string hosts</h4>
        <p>
            If you have a faction server, you could use the names of the factions as the string hosts. This will result in
            every faction having their own custom container inventory that members can access via commands or scripts. If
            you use commands, I recommend using permissions to ensure players can only open the container inventory of their
            own faction. You could use this as a shared faction storage or a custom container with powerful container recipes
            with long durations (so every faction can only perform 1 powerful recipe at the same time and needs to choose
            wisely).
        </p>
        <h4>Using entity UUIDs as string hosts</h5>
        <p>
            In Minecraft, every entity has its own UUID, which you could use as string host. This will result in having a
            container inventory per entity. This could be used to assign custom containers to animals, NPCs, and minecarts. 
            This could probably be useful in combination with Citizens.
        </p>
        <h4>More ways</h4>
        <p>
            This was just a small list of ideas to give you some inspiration. There are countless other string hosts you can
            use and you can probably come up with other useful ways if you take some time to think about it.
        </p>
        <h3>Cleaning up</h3>
        <p>
            When a regular custom container is hosted by a block, and that block gets broken, the container is automatically
            destroyed, and its items will be dropped on the ground. If you use string hosts, there is no such clean-up
            mechanism: the container inventory will remain in memory (and on disk) until you destroy it with a command or
            script. Depending on your usecase, this may or may not be desired. (For instance, keeping faction inventory
            indefinitely is probably fine, but entity inventories should probably be cleaned up when the host entity dies.
            In this case, you could use a script that destroys the containers of each entity when they die.)
        </p>
        <p>
            Just like opening a container at a string host, there are 3 ways to destroy a container at a string host:
            commands, Skripts, and Denizen scripts. Furthermore, you can choose whether you want the inventory content to
            be dropped or destroyed. To destroy the inventory contents, use:
        </p>
        <ul>
            <li>This command: /kci container destroy <b>container_name</b> <b>string_host</b></li>
            <li>This Skript: destroy kci "<b>container_name</b>" at "<b>string_host</b>"</li>
            <li>This Denizen script: kci_container destroy <b>container_name</b> at <b>string_host</b></li>
        </ul>
        If you would like to drop the inventory contents at a given location, use 1 of these instead:
        <ul>
            <li>This command: /kci container destroy <b>container_name</b> <b>string_host</b> <b>world_name</b> <b>x</b> <b>y</b> <b>z</b></li>
            <li>This Skript: destroy kci "<b>container_name</b>" at "<b>string_host</b>" and drop its items at <b>drop_location</b></li>
            <li>This Denizen script: kci_container destroy <b>container_name</b> at <b>string_host</b> and drop items at <b>drop_location</b></li>
        </ul>
