        <p>
            The container recipe overview can be used to view and modify the list of recipes of a given
            custom container. If the custom container you're editing has a single recipe with a single 
            diamond as output, it should look like this:
        </p>
        <img src="overview.png" width="50%" />
        <ul>
            <li>
                The 'Back' button will take you back to the <a href="../edit.html">container edit menu</a>
                for the container you're currently creating or editing.
            </li>
            <li>
                The edit field below 'Search:' can be used to filter on recipes with a given result.
                (Actually recipes whose textual description contains the text inside that edit field.)
            </li>
            <li>
                The 'Add recipe' button will take you to the <a href="edit.html">container recipe edit menu</a>,
                where you can create a new recipe to add to the list of recipes of this custom container.
            </li>
            <li>
                The 'Edit' button will take you to the <a href="edit.html">container recipe edit menu</a>,
                where you can modify the corresponding recipe (in this case the recipe with 1 diamond as output).
            </li>
            <li>
                The 'Copy' button will also take you to the <a href="edit.html">container recipe edit menu</a>. 
                All fields and slots will be filled in with the values of the corresponding recipe, but Ã½ou 
                are creating a new recipe rather than modifying it.
            </li>
            <li>
                'The 'Delete' button will remove the corresponding container recipe from this list of container 
                recipes.
            </li>
        </ul>
    </body>
