        <p>
            The container recipe energy menu can be used to configure whether a container recipe requires, generates,
            or drains energy from its custom container. This menu should look like this:
        </p>
        <img src="energy.png" width="50%" />
        <p>
            In this menu, you can configure a list of energy entries, where each energy entry has the following properties:
        </p>
        <ul>
            <li>
                An <b>energy type</b>: the stored energy from this energy type will be used.
            </li>
            <li>
                An <b>operation</b>: the operation determines what happens with the stored energy. 
                There are 4 possible operations:
                <ul>
                    <li>
                        <b>Require at least</b>: the container recipe can only happen when its container has at least
                        <b>value</b> energy of the <b>energy type</b>.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        <b>Require at most</b>: the container recipe can only happen when its container has at most
                        <b>value</b> energy of the <b>energy type</b>.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        <b>Decrease</b>: the containers energy of the <b>energy type</b> will be decreased by
                        <b>value</b>. If this would cause the energy to go below the minimum value of <b>energy type</b>,
                        it will be set to the minimum value instead.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        <b>Increase</b>: the containers energy of the <b>energy type</b> will be increased by
                        <b>value</b>. If this would cause the energy to go over the maximum value of <b>energy type</b>,
                        it will be set to the maximum value instead.
                    </li>
                </ul>
                Note: when you use <b>Decrease</b>, you would normally also want to use <b>Require at least</b> with
                the same value and energy type to ensure that there is enough energy to drain. (And similarly, you would
                also want to use <b>Require at most</b> if you use <b>Increase</b>).
            </li>
            <li>
                The <b>value</b>: this is the value/amount that is required or will be increased/decreased.
            </li>
        </ul>
