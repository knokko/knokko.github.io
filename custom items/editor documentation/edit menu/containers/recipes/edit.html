    </head>
    <body>
        <p>
            The container recipe edit menu can be used to create or modify recipes of a given custom container.
            A container recipe has inputs and outputs. The inputs determine which items need to be present in 
            which input slots of the container. The outputs determine which items will appear in which output 
            slots. 
        </p>
        <p>
            The process is similar to that of a furnace: if there is a valid combination of input items 
            and there is fuel (or the container is still burning), it will start converting the inputs to
            outputs. After a couple of seconds, the input items will vanish and the output items will appear.
            (If the input items weren't taken away and the furnace didn't stop burning in the meantime.) For 
            container recipes, you can also choose how long this takes and how much xp is granted. (But the 
            xp works a little differently because there can be more than 1 output).
        </p>
        <p>
            If you use <b>manual</b> output slots rather than regular output slots, the process will instead be similar
            to that of a crafting table: if there is a valid combination of input items, the output item will immediately
            appear in the manual output slot, and the input items will be consumed when the player takes the result from
            the manual output slot.
        </p>
        <p>
            If you just started creating a new recipe for a custom container with a single input slot and a 
            single output slot, it should look like this:
        </p>
        <img src="edit.png" width="50%" />
        <ul>
            <li>
                The 'Cancel' button will take you back to the 
                <a href="overview.html">container recipe overview</a>, without keeping potential changes
                made to this container recipe and without adding it to the list of container recipes.
            </li>
            <li>
                If you are creating a new container recipe, there will be a 'Create' button, which will 
                add the container recipe you're creating to the list of container recipes. If it succeeds,
                it will also take you back to the <a href="overview.html">container recipe overview</a>.
            </li>
            <li>
                If you are editing an existing container recipe, there will be an 'Apply' button, which will 
                keep the changes you made to this container recipe. If no errors occurred, it will also take 
                you back to the <a href="overview.html">container recipe overview</a>.
            </li>
            <li>
                In the edit field on the right of 'Duration:', you should insert the duration of the recipe. 
                You need to give the duration in <i>ticks</i>, <b>not</b> <i>seconds</i>. 1 second = 20 ticks.
                The duration must be a positive integer or 0 (which means that it's instant).
            </li>
            <li>
                In the edit field on the right of 'Experience:', you should insert the amount of experience 
                you would like players to get upon touching the first result. 
            </li>
            <li>
                If you leave the <b>Required permission</b> empty, any player will be able to use this
                recipe. If you insert a permission in this field, only players with that permission or the
                <b>customitems.container.recipe.any</b> permission will be able to use this recipe.<br>
                <b>However, this is only applicable when the <i>Storage mode</i> of the container is
                <i>NOT_PERSISTENT</i>, <i>PER_LOCATION_PER_PLAYER</i>, or <i>PER_PLAYER</i>.</b>
                (Permissions make little sense when the container is shared between all players since
                each of these players can have different permissions.)
            </li>
            <li>
                When you click the <b>Energy...</b> button, you can configure whether this container recipe
                requires, generates, or drains container energy. It will take you to the
                <a href="energy.html">container recipe energy menu</a>.
            </li>
        </ul>
        <h3>The grid</h3>
        <p>
            Finally, there is a version of the containers slot grid that occupies most of the space. For 
            container recipes, only the input slots and output slots are interesting. The input slots will 
            be marked blue, the output slots will be marked red, the manual output slots will be marked dark red, 
            and the rest will be gray. The name of all the slots are shown as well.
        </p>
        <p>
            By clicking on any of the input slots, you can choose which ingredient this recipe needs to be
            in that slot, using the 
            <a href="../../recipes/choose ingredient.html">choose ingredient menu</a>. 
            If you leave an input slot empty (or reset it to empty), this recipe will ignore that input 
            slot. If you would leave all input slots empty, the container would produce the output 
            continuously until it runs out of fuel or the output slot is full.
        </p>
        <p>
            By clicking on any of the output slots, you can choose which results this recipe may put in 
            that slot, using the <a href="../../recipes/output table.html">output table menu</a>.
            If you leave an output slot empty, the recipe will ignore that output slot. If you would leave 
            all output slots emtpy, the container would basically consume the input and only produce xp.
        </p>
        <p>
            By clicking on any of the manual output slots, you can choose which result will be put in that
            slot. Unlike regular output slots, manual output slots can only have 1 result. Also, every recipe
            can have at most 1 manual output slot.
        </p>
        <p>
            <b>Right</b>-clicking any input or (manual) output slot will remove the corresponding ingredient
            or result from this recipe.
        </p>
        <h3>Copy & pasting inputs/outputs</h3>
        <p>
            You can copy an ingredient by pressing the 'c' button while hovering over an ingredient and paste an
            ingredient by pressing the 'p' button while hovering over the destination slot. Similarly, you can
            copy results.
        </p>
        <h3>Missing slots</h3>
        <p>
            If you rename or remove any input or output slots used by this recipe, it will get 
            <i>missing slots</i>. As long as any recipes have missing slots, the custom container 
            can't be created and the changes can't be applied. If the recipe you're currently editing 
            has any missing slots, they will be shown below the grid. To fix that, you can either add 
            a new slot with the name of the missing slot, or click on the X on the right of the 
            missing slot name to remove the ingredient or result corresponding to that slot.
