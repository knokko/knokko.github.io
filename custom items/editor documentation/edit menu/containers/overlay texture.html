    <body>
        <p>
            The container overlay texture menu can be used to view the current overlay texture of a custom container,
            replace it, or generate a template texture for it. If you haven't chosen an overlay texture yet, this menu
            should look like this:
        </p>
        <img src="overlay texture none.png" width="50%" />
        <p>
            But if you <i>did</i> choose an overlay texture, it should look like this instead:
        </p>
        <img src="overlay texture.png" width="50%" />
        <h2>Buttons</h2>
        <h3>Back</h3>
        <p>
            The <i>Back</i> button will take you back to the <a href="edit.html">container edit menu</a>.
        </p>
        <h3>Save to file</h3>
        <p>
            The <i>Save to file</i> button will save the current overlay texture of the custom container to the file
            <b>Custom Item Sets/containers/CONTAINER NAME/overlay.png</b>. After the file was saved, it should
            automatically be opened in your default image editor program. This can be useful if you would like to
            make small changes to the overlay texture. (This button is only visible if the current container has an
            overlay texture.) <b>This button is very useful in combination with the 
            <i>Choose saved file as overlay texture</i> button.</b>
        </p>
        <h3>Generate template</h3>
        <p>
            The <i>Generate template</i> button will create a <i>template overlay texture</i> for the custom container
            at the file <b>Custom Item Sets/containers/CONTAINER NAME/template.png</b>. After generating the template,
            it should automatically be opened in your default image editor program. The template is a very simple
            'example' overlay texture that shows you where the edges of the custom container and its slots are, which
            should make it easy for you to edit. <b>This button is very useful in combination with the 
            <i>Choose template file as overlay texture</i> button.</b>
        </p>
        <h3>Choose overlay texture...</h3>
        <p>
            The <i>Choose overlay texture...</i> button will open the file chooser menu, where you can choose the
            overlay texture for the custom container. While this is possible, it is usually more convenient to use
            the <i>Choose template file as overlay</i> button or the <i>Choose saved file as overlay texture</i>
            button.
        </p>
        <h3>Choose template file as overlay texture</h3>
        <p>
            Chooses the image stored at the template file location (Custom Item Sets/container/CONTAINER NAME/template.png)
            as the overlay texture of the container. This button is useful in combination with the <i>Generate template</i>
            button:
        </p>
        <ol>
            <li>Click <i>Generate template</i>, which should open the template image in your default image editor</li>
            <li>Edit the template texture until you're happy with it</li>
            <li>Save the template texture in your image editor</li>
            <li>Click <i>Choose template file as overlay texture</i>, which should choose the <i>modified</i> template
            texture as your overlay texture.</li>
        </ol>
        <h3>Choose saved file as overlay texture</h3>
        <p>
            Chooses the image stored at the saved file location (Custom Item Sets/container/CONTAINER NAME/overlay.png)
            as the overlay texture of the container. This button is useful in combination with the <i>Save to file</i>
            button:
        </p>
        <ol>
            <li>Click <i>Save to file</i>, which should open the previous overlay texture in your default image editor</li>
            <li>Edit the overlay texture until you're happy with it</li>
            <li>Save the overlay texture in your image editor</li>
            <li>Click <i>Choose saved file as overlay texture</i>, which should choose the <i>modified</i> overlay
            texture as your <i>new</i> overlay texture.</li>
        </ol>
        <h3>Delete template file</h3>
        <p>
            Deletes the template file (Custom Item Sets/container/CONTAINER NAME/template.png). This is just a convenient
            button to avoid the need for you to travel to the template file in your file system and delete it manually.
            Deleting the template file is needed when you want to generate a new template file because the
            <i>Generate template</i> button will <b>not</b> work if a template texture already exists (to prevent you from
            accidentally deleting all of your image editing work).
