            The fuel registry edit menu can be used to modify custom fuel registries or create new ones.
            If you just started creating a new fuel registry, it should look like this:
        </p>
        <img src="edit.png" width="50%" />
        <ul>
            <li>
                The 'Cancel' button will take you back to the 
                <a href="overview.html">fuel registry overview</a>, without keeping changed made to this 
                fuel registry or creating a new one.
            </li>
            <li>
                If you are creating a new fuel registry, there will be a 'Create' button. Clicking it will 
                add the fuel registry you're designing, and take you back to the
                <a href="overview.html">fuel registry overview</a> if it went well.
            </li>
            <li>
                If you are editing an existing fuel registry, there will be an 'Apply' button. Clicking it 
                will take you back to the <a href="overview.html">fuel registry overview</a> and keep the 
                changes you made to it.
            </li>
            <li>
                You need to type the name of the fuel registry in the text edit field on the right of
                'Name:'. Currently, the name is not used in the plug-in; it's only purpose is to
                distinguis different fuel registries from each other.
            </li>
            <li>
                The most important part of a fuel registry is the list of entries. These actually determine
                which items are considered fuel. To change this list, click on the 'Entries...' button,
                which will take you to the <a href="entries.html">fuel entries menu</a> for this
                fuel registry.
            </li>
        </ul>
