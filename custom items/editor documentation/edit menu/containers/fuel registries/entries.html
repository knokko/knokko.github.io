            The fuel entries menu can be used to configure which items count as fuel in a given fuel registry.
            It is basically a list of items with associated durations (how long a container burns when this
            item is used as fuel). If you have a single entry that allows coal to keep the container burning
            for 5 seconds, it should look like this:
        </p>
        <img src="entries.png" width="50%" />
        <ul>
            <li>
                The 'Cancel' button will take you back to the <a href="edit.html">fuel registry edit menu</a>
                you came from, without keeping any changed you made in this menu.
            </li>
            <li>
                The 'Apply' button will take you back to the <a href="edit.html">fuel registry edit menu</a>,
                and keep all changes made here.
            </li>
            <li>
                The 'Add new' button will add a new entry to the list of entries. It will be an entry with 
                coal as item and a burning duration of 100 ticks, but you can change this afterwards.
            </li>
        </ul>
        <p>
            Furthermore, there are a couple of components for every entry that is currently in the entry 
            list:
        </p>
        <ul>
            <li>
                The left-most button shows the item of the entry (the item that will be treated as fuel).
                You can change the item by clicking this button, which takes you to the 
                <a href="../../recipes/input type select.html">input type selection menu</a>, where you can 
                choose which item you want to be considered fuel.
            </li>
            <li>
                The edit field in the middle determines how long the fuel item will cause the custom 
                container to burn. This duration is expected to be given in <i>ticks</i>, <b>not</b>
                <i>seconds</i> (1 second = 20 ticks). Also, the duration must be a positive integer.
            </li>
            <li>
                The red cross on the right can be used to remove the entry from the list.
            </li>
        </ul>
    </body>
