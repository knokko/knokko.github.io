            The entity list menu is the root menu from which you can select mobs (and other entities) that will drop an item.
            It should look like this:
        </p>
        <img src="mob list.png" width="50%" />
        <p>
            The menu consist out of the cancel button and a list of entities.
        </p>
        <a>
            The 'Cancel' button will bring you back to the <a href="mobs.html">Mob Drop Menu</a> without selecting an entity.
        </p>
        <p>
            Clicking on an entity name will select that entity and bring you back to the <a href="mobs.html">Mob Drop Menu</a> and the menu will display what entity you have chosen.
            Some entities have a minecraft verison behind them in brackets, this indicates that the item set will only work on the minecraft version indicated, or above.
