            The allowed biomes menu allows you to configure in which biomes a custom mob drop or block drop can occur.
            It should look like this:
        </p>
        <img src="allowed biomes.png" width="50%" />
        <h3>Whitelist</h3>
        <p>
            The orange box in the middle is the <i>biome whitelist</i>. If you add at least 1 biome to the whitelist, this
            custom drop can only occur in those biomes. If you leave the whitelist empty, this custom drop can occur in all
            biomes that are not on the <i>blacklist</i>.
        </p>
        <h3>Blacklist</h3>
        <p>
            The orange box on the right is the <i>biome blacklist</i>. This custom drop can <b>not</b> occur in any biome that
            is on the blacklist.
