            The custom items selection menu can be used to select multiple custom 
            items (but 1 item or no items are also allowed). This menu should look
            like this:
        </p>
        <img src="custom items selection.png" width="50%" />
        <p>
            This menu has a list of <b>selected</b> items and <b>selectable</b>
            items. The selected items are the items that you have selected. All 
            other items are in the selectable items. Clicking on a selectable item 
            will move it to the selected items. Clicking on a selected item will 
            move it back to the selectable items.
        </p>
        <p>
            If you are selecting items for a block drop or mob drop and haven't
            selected any custom items, the player will be able to use any custom 
            item. If you have selected at least 1 custom item, the player will 
            have to use one of the selected items.
        </p>
        <b>Buttons</b>
        <p>
            The 'Cancel' button will take you back to the menu you came from,
            without keeping the changes you made in this menu.
        </p>
        <p>
            The 'Apply' button will keep the changes you made in this menu, and
            then take you back to the previous menu.
        </p>
        <p>
            Clicking on any button below 'Selected items:' will unselect the item 
            corresponding to that button.
        </p>
        <p>
            Clicking on any button below 'Selectable items:' will select the item 
            corresponding to that button.
        </p>
        <p>
            The edit field below 'Search:' allows you to filter on the <b>selectable</b>
            items. Only the selectable items whose name contains the text you type
            into that field will be shown.
