            The drop menu is the menu where you can select which items should have 
            which chance to be dropped. You can also select some additional
            restrictions.
        </p>

        <h2>Buttons</h2>
        <h3>Items to drop</h3>
        <p>
            The 'Choose...' button on the right of 'Items to drop:' will take you 
            to the <a href="../recipes/output table.html">output table menu</a>. In 
            that menu, you can choose which items should have which chance to be
            dropped. Note that at most 1 of the entries you choose can be dropped.
            If you want to drop more than 1 type of item at the same time, you will 
            have to create multiple mob or block drops.
        </p>
        <h3>Items that must be held/used:</h3>
        <p>
            The 'Choose...' button on the right of 'Items that must be held/used:'
            will take you to the 
            <a href="custom items selection.html">custom items selection menu</a>
            where you can select which items the player must use in order to be
            able to get this drop. To give an example, the following will happen 
            if you select only a ruby pickaxe (a custom item):
            <ul>
                <li>
                    If this drop is for a block drop (for instance for the block 
                    stone in), this drop can only happen when some player breaks
                    a stone using a ruby pickaxe.
                </li>
                <li>
                    If this drop is for a mob drop (for instance for zombies),
                    this drop can only happen when some player kills a zombie with 
                    a ruby pickaxe.
                </li>
            </ul>
            When you select multiple custom items, the drop can happen when a player 
            uses one of these custom items. When you don't select any custom items,
            the drop can always happen, no matter what items players use. If you 
            select a custom bow and this drop is for a mob drop, the drop can also 
            happen when a player shoots the right mob to death with that custom bow.
        </p>
        <h3>Allowed biomes</h3>
        <p>
            The 'Choose...' button on the right of 'Allowed biomes:' will take you to the 
            <a href="allowed biomes.html">allowed biomes menu</a> where you can configure
            in which biomes this drop can happen (and in which biomes it can't happen).
        </p>
        <h3>Prevent normal Drops (not for custom blocks)</h3>
        <p>
            If this checkbox is checked and an item is dropped because of this drop,
            no normal items will be dropped. (If this drop is for a zombie, no rotten 
            flesh will be dropped. If this drop is for stone, no cobblestone will be 
            dropped.)
