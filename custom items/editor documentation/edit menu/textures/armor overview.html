            Note: before MC 1.21, armor textures can only be seen by players who installed 
            the Optifine mod.

        <p>
            The armor texture overview can be used to view, edit, create, and
            delete armor textures. If you have made a single armor texture
            called 'red_gold', it should look like this:
        </p>
        <img src="armor overview.png" width="50%" />
        <ul>
            <li>
                Clicking the 'Back' button will take you back to the 
                <a href="overview.html">texture overview</a>.
            </li>
            <li>
                Clicking 'Create new' will take you to the 
                <a href="armor edit.html">armor texture edit menu</a>, where you 
                can load a new armor texture.
            </li>
            <li>
                Clicking on an 'Edit' button will take you to the 
                <a href="armor edit.html">armor texture edit menu</a>, where you 
                can edit the corresponding armor texture.
            </li>
            <li>
                Clicking on a 'Copy' button will take you to the 
                <a href="armor edit.html">armor texture edit menu</a> with the 
                name and textures of the corresponding armor texture.
                However, clicking 'Apply' will add a <i>new</i> armor texture 
                with these properties, rather than modifying the original one.
                But before doing that, you will have to change at least the 
                Name (because all armor textures must have a different name).
            </li>
            <li>
                Clicking on a 'Delete' button will remove the corresponding 
                armor texture. Note that this will <b>not</b> remove the 
                actual images from your file system, so it shouldn't take 
                much time to recreate it.
            </li>
        </ul>
