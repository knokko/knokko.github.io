            In the texture type selection, you can choose what kind of texture you want to load.
            It should look like this:
        </p>
        <img src="type selection.png" width="50%" />
        <p>
            Currently, there are 2 types of textures: normal textures and bow textures.
            As the name suggests, bow textures are for bows.
            Normal textures are for all other items.
            As you can see, each type has its own button:
            <ul>
                <li>The 'Load simple texture' button will bring you to the <a href="edit.html">texture edit menu</a> where you can choose a name
                and select an image.</li>
                <li>The 'Load bow texture' button will bring you to the <a href="bow edit.html">bow texture edit menu</a> where you can
                choose a name and image, but also select images for the pulling textures.</li>
            </ul>
            Finally, there is the 'Back' button that will bring you back to the <a href="overview.html">texture overview</a> without loading
            a new texture.
