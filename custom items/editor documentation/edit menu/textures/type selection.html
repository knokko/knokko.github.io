            In the texture type selection, you can choose what kind of texture you want to load.
            It should look like this:
        </p>
        <img src="type selection.png" width="50%" />
        <p>
            Currently, there are 3 types of textures: normal textures, bow textures, and crossbow textures.
            As the names suggests, bow textures are for bows and crossbow textures are for crossbows.
            Normal textures are for all other items.
            As you can see, each type has its own button:
            <ul>
                <li>The 'Load simple texture' button will take you to the 
                    <a href="edit.html">texture edit menu</a> where you can choose 
                    a name and select an image.</li>
                <li>The 'Load bow texture' button will take you to the 
                    <a href="bow edit.html">bow texture edit menu</a> where you can
                choose a name and image, but also select images for the 
                pulling textures.</li>
                <li>The 'Load crossbow texture' button will take you to the 
                    <a href="crossbow edit.html">crossbow texture edit menu</a> 
                    where you can choose a name and image, but also select 
                    images for the pulling textures and the images for when an 
                    arrow or firework rocket is loaded onto the crossbow.</li>

            </ul>
            Finally, there is the 'Back' button that will bring you back to the 
            <a href="overview.html">texture overview</a> without loading
            a new texture.
