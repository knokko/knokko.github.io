        <p>
            The crossbow texture edit menu can be used to create or edit the
            textures for a custom crossbow. When you just started creating new
            crossbow textures, it should look like this:
        </p>
        <img src="crossbow edit.png" width="50%" />
        <ul>
            <li>
                Clicking the <i>Cancel</i> button will take you back to the 
                <a href="overview.html">texture overview</a>, without keeping any
                changes you made here.
            </li>
            <li>
                If you are creating new crossbow textures, there will be a <i>Create</i>
                button. Clicking it will add the new crossbow textures and then take
                you back to the <a href="overview.html">texture overview</a>.
            </li>
            <li>
                If you are modifying existing crossbow textures, there will be an 
                <i>Apply</i> button. Clicking it will keep the changes and take you 
                back to the <a href="overview.html">texture overview</a>.
            </li>
            <li>
                The <i>Name</i> field can be used to choose the name of the crossbow 
                texture. Currently, only English alphabet characters and underscores
                are allowed in names. This name will only be shown within the Editor;
                it will not be shown in-game.
            </li>
            <li>
                The <i>Standby image</i> is the image that players will see when 
                the crossbow is not loading or charged. The regular minecraft crossbow 
                uses this image: <img src="crossbow_standby.png" />
            </li>
            <li>
                The <i>Arrow image</i> is the image that players will see when the 
                crossbow is charged with an arrow. The regular minecraft crossbow 
                uses this image: <img src="crossbow_arrow.png" />
            </li>
            <li>
                The <i>Firework image</i> is the image that players will see when the 
                crossbow is charged with a firework rocket. The regular minecraft 
                crossbow uses this image: <img src="crossbow_firework.png" />
            </li>
            <li>
                Clicking the green <i>+</i> button will add a new <b>pull texture</b>
                to the crossbow textures. (See the section below for more information.)
            </li>
        </ul>
        <h3>Pull textures</h3>
        <p>
            The pull textures control how the crossbow will look while a player is 
            pulling/loading it. Multiple pull textures are used to create the 
            pulling/loading animation. Each pull texture has the following
            properties:
        </p>
        <ul>
            <li>
                The <i>Pull</i> value determines <i>when</i> it will be displayed.
                A value of 0.0 indicates that it will be shown as soon as the player 
                starts pulling the crossbow. A value of 0.5 indicates that it will 
                be shown when the player is halfway there. A value of 1.0
                indicates that it will be shown once the player has pulled the 
                crossbow long enough and is ready to put an arrow (or firework rocket)
                on it. Any value between 0.0 and 1.0 can be used.
            </li>
            <li>
                The <i>Image</i> will be displayed when the crossbow is in the right 
                'stage' of the pulling.
            </li>
        </ul>
        <p>
            The default minecraft crossbow uses the following pull values and 
            textures (explicitly in that order!):
        </p>
        <ol>
            <li>Pull value 0.0: <img src="crossbow_pulling_0.png" /></li>
            <li>Pull value 0.5: <img src="crossbow_pulling_1.png" /></li>
            <li>Pull value 1.0: <img src="crossbow_pulling_2.png" /></li>
        </ol>
        <p>
            You are free to use more or lesser pulling images and use different
            pull values, but if you do, you will have to create the pulling images 
            yourself.
