        <p>
            The FancyPants armor edit menu can be used to create
            <a href="https://github.com/Ancientkingg/fancyPants">FancyPants</a> custom armor textures. This allows
            you to create custom leather armor textures in minecraft 1.17 and later, and optionally animate it or let it
            emit light. In it simplest form, it should look like this:
        </p>
        <img src="fancypants edit simple.png" width="50%" />
        <h3>Name</h3>
        <p>
            The distinct name of this armor texture. Currently, the name is only shown in the Editor, but is not
            really used anywhere.
        </p>
        <h3>RGB</h3>
        <p>
            The leather color RGB value that will be claimed for this armor texture. Every piece of leather armor
            in minecraft has an RGB value that normally determines its color. FancyPants makes it possible to
            completely change the texture, animation, and emissivity of leather armor with a specific RGB value.
            By default, the Editor will automatically assign a fresh RGB value to each custom armor texture.
            Most users won't need to change this field.
        </p>
        <h3>Emissivity</h3>
        <p>
            The emissivity determines whether this armor texture will emit light. There are 3 possible options:
        </p>
        <ul>
            <li><b>NONE</b>: this armor texture does <b>not</b> emit light.</li>
            <li><b>FULL</b>: this armor texture has maximum light emissivity.</li>
            <li>
                <b>PARTIAL</b>: this armor texture emits light at <i>some</i> pixels. You need to specify
                an extra texture where the <b>alpha</b> components of the pixels determine the emissivity
                at their respective locations.
            </li>
        </ul>
        <h3>Leather tint</h3>
        <p>
            Whether the 'default' leather texture coloring should be applied. You probably don't want this,
            but you are free to enable it.
        </p>
        <h3>Frames</h3>
        <p>
            The animation frames of this armor texture. Every armor texture needs to have 1 or more frames.
            If you use only 1 frame, the texture won't have an animation. Every frame needs a layer1 texture
            and a layer2 texture. If you are using <b>PARTIAL</b> emissivity, every frame also needs an
            emissivity texture for each of the two layers. For reference, the default layer1 of diamond
            armor is <img src="./diamond_layer_1.png" /> and the default layer2 of diamond armor is
            <img src="./diamond_layer_2.png" />. If you have at least 2 frames, two more fields should
            appear:
        </p>
        <img src="fancypants edit complex.png" width="50%" />
        <h3>Animation speed</h3>
        <p>
            The animation speed determines how quickly the frames will be displayed after each other. An
            animation speed of 24 is approximately 1 frame per second.
        </p>
        <h3>Interpolate animations</h3>
        <p>
            Whether the animation frames should be interpolated. Without interpolation, the frames will be
            swapped abruptly. When you enable interpolation, the transition between animation frames will be smooth.
