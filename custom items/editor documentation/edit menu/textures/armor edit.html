            Note: before MC 1.21, armor textures are only visible for players who installed the 
            Optifine mod.

        <p>
            The armor texture edit menu can be used to create, edit, or copy
            armor textures. If you just started creating a new armor texture,
            it should look like this:
        </p>
        <img src="armor edit.png" width="50%" />
        <ul>
            <li>
                The 'Cancel' button will take you back to the 
                <a href="armor overview.html">armor overview</a>, without keeping
                the changes you made or creating a new armor texture.
            </li>
            <li>
                If you are editing an existing armor texture, clicking the 'Apply'
                button will keep your changes and then take you back to the 
                <a href="armor overview.html">armor overview</a>. If you are 
                creating a new armor texture or copying and existing armor texture,
                clicking the 'Apply' button will add this armor texture to the 
                item set and then take you back to the 
                <a href="armor overview.html">armor overview</a>.
            </li>
            <li>
                The edit field on the right of 'Name' can be used to choose the name 
                of the armor texture. Every armor texture must have a distinct name.
                Currently, the naming rules are very strict: only the English alphabet
                ('a' to 'z'), the digits '0' to '9', and the '_' are allowed as 
                characters. Note that players won't see this name anyway (unless they 
                take a deep look inside the resourcepack).
            </li>
            <li>
                Click the 'Change...' button on the right of 'Layer 1:' to choose the 
                layer1 texture of the armor. This will take you to the file chooser
                menu, where you can choose the right image. It must be a PNG file.
                To give an impression of what such a texture should look like, the 
                texture for regular diamond armor is shown below:<br>
                <img src="diamond_layer_1.png" /><br>
                You can download it by right-clicking it and choosing 'Save image as'
                or something similar (the exact way depends on your browser).
            </li>
            <li>
                Similarly, you can click the 'Change...' button on the right of
                'Layer 2:' to choose the layer2 texture. To give an impression, the 
                layer2 of regular diamond armor is:<br>
                <img src="diamond_layer_2.png" />
            </li>
        </ul>
