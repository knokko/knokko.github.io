            The block producer menu can be used to configure which block(s) will be used to create a tree or a vein
            of ores. It should look like this:
        </p>
        <img src="block producer.png" width="50%" />
        <p>
            A block producer is basically a list of blocks with an associated chance that the block will be chosen.
            You can choose from both vanilla blocks and custom blocks. If you create an ore vein with multiple
            entries, most veins will consist of multiple of these blocks. If the total chance is less than 100%,
            the generator can skip some blocks.
