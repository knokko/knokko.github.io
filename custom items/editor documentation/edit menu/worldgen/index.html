            The world generation portal gives an overview of all world generation possibilities provided by this
            plug-in. It should look like this:
        </p>
        <img src="index.png" width="50%" />
        <p>
            Currently, this plug-in only supports <a href="tree/overview.html">tree generators</a> 
            and <a href="ore/overview.html">ore vein generators</a>. Because Spigot reworked the custom tree mechanics
            in minecraft 1.13, custom trees are only supported in minecraft 1.13 and later. Except that minecraft 1.16
            is not supported because Spigot introduced a bug in 1.16 and fixed it in 1.17.

            If you want more advanced world generation,
            you can check out <a href="https://www.spigotmc.org/resources/terra.85151/">Terra</a>. Note: you can
            find instructions for working with custom blocks 
            <a href="https://github.com/PolyhedralDev/TerraWiki/wiki/Custom-Blocks">here</a> (although this is the
            archived wiki, it might still work more or less the same in the modern versions).
