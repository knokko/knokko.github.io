            The ore vein generator menu can be used to create or edit an ore vein generator. It should look
            like this:

        <p>
            An ore vein generator will attempt to replace some <i>Blocks to replace</i> with some <i>Ore blocks</i>,
            where you can choose which blocks these are, as well as how many veins to spawn and how big those veins
            should be. Each of these properties will be explained in more detail below.
        </p>
        <h3>Blocks to replace</h3>
        <p>
            Veins of ore always need to <b>replace</b> existing blocks. For instance, coal ore and iron ore will
            replace stone, while quartz ore will replace netherrack. You can choose which block(s) you want to
            replace by your <i>Ore blocks</i>.
        </p>
        <h3>Allowed biomes</h3>
        <p>
            The biomes in which the <i>Ore blocks</i> can be generated. Veins can't be started in forbidden biomes, nor
            can they grow into forbidden biomes.
        </p>
        <h3>Ore blocks</h3>
        <p>
            The blocks by which the <i>Blocks to replace</i> should be replaced. For instance, vanilla ore blocks are
            coal ore, iron ore, diamond ore... You can choose any custom block or vanilla block(s) you want. If you
            choose multiple, you can get <i>mixed</i> veins.
        </p>
        <h3>Minimum/maximum Y-coordinate</h3>
        <p>
            The ore blocks will only be spawned on blocks whose Y-coordinate is between the minimum and maximum
            Y-coordinate. Note: when the difference between the minimum and maximum Y-coordinate is large, the
            veins will typically be further apart from each other.
        </p>
        <h3>Chance</h3>
        <p>
            For each chunk, this is the chance that the ore vein generator will <b>not</b> skip the chunk.
        </p>
        <h3>Number of vein( attempt)s</h3>
        <p>
            These 3 properties determine how many veins of ore the generator will (attempt to) spawn per chunk.
            For each chunk, the generator will randomly choose a <i>desired</i> number of veins between
            the <i>minimum</i> number of veins and the <i>maximum</i> number of veins. It will attempt to
            spawn this number of veins, but this may or may not be possible (for instance when the chunk
            is in the wrong biome or none of the <i>Blocks to replace</i> can be found). It will do at most
            <i>Maximum number of vein attempts</i> to spawn a vein of ore. In each attempt, it will try to
            start a vein of ore in a random position between the minimum and maximum Y-coordinate. The vein
            will be considered a success if the first ore block is placed.
        </p>
        <h3>Vein size & grow attempts</h3>
        <p>
            These 3 properties determine how big each vein will be. For each vein, the generator will randomly
            choose a <i>desired</i> vein size between the <i>minimum</i> vein size and the <i>maximum</i>
            vein size. It will attempt to create a vein of this size, but this may or may not be possible
            (for instance because there is too much gravel or granite near the vein). It will do at most
            <i>Maximum number of grow attempts</i> to increment the size of the vein. It will start in the
            first block, and during each grow attempt, it will move in a random direction and attempt to place
            an ore block at its new location.
