            The ore vein generator overview can be used to view and manage your ore vein generators. An ore vein
            generator is a world generation process that will attempt to replace some blocks (typically stone)
            with veins of ore (for instance coal ore). This menu should look like this:

        <p>
            You can use the <i>Add...</i> to add new ore vein generators and you can use the <i>Edit</i>, <i>Copy</i>,
            and <i>Delete</i> buttons to interact with existing ore vein generators.
