            The replace blocks menu can be used to configure which block(s) can be replaced by a (custom) ore vein
            generator. It should look like this:
        </p>
        <img src="replace blocks.png" width="50%" />
        <p>
            You can select both vanilla blocks and custom blocks. Each of the blocks you add here can be replaced
            by an ore block of the ore vein generator. In most cases, you should only choose <i>Stone</i>, but
            you are free to choose any block(s) you want.
