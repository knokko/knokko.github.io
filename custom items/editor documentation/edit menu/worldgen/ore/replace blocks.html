        <p>
            The replace blocks menu can be used to configure which block(s) can be replaced by a (custom) ore vein
            generator. It can also be used to configure on which block(s) custom trees can grow. It should look like this:
        </p>
        <img src="replace blocks.png" width="50%" />
        You can select both vanilla blocks and custom blocks.
        <h2>Replacing blocks</h2>
        <p>
            When configuring the replacable blocks of a custom ore vein, each of the blocks you add here can be replaced
            by an ore block of the ore vein generator. In most cases, you should only choose <i>Stone</i>, but
            you are free to choose any block(s) you want.
        </p>
        <h2>Allowed tree terrain</h2>
        <p>
            When you are configuring the terrain on which a custom tree can grow, the trees can grow on any of the
            blocks you select here. For regular trees, you should usually choose just <i>Dirt</i> and <i>Grass block</i>.
