        <p>
            The tree generator edit menu can be used to edit tree generators. It should look like this:
        </p>
        <img src="edit.png" width="50%" />
        <p>
            A tree generator is a world generation process that will attempt to spawn some number of customized
            trees in some chunks. You can specify the shape of the tree, as well as which block(s) should be used
            for the logs and which block(s) should be used for the leaves (if applicable). Furthermore, you can
            specify in which biome(s) the tree can spawn and how many should be spawned. Each option will be
            explained in more detail below.
        </p>
        <h3>Tree shape</h3>
        <p>
            The tree shape determines the shape of the tree. In minecraft 1.17 and earlier, it also determines on which 
            blocks the tree can be spawned (most tree shapes can only be spawned on grass or dirt).
        </p>
        <h3>Allowed biomes</h3>
        <p>
            The biomes in which the tree can be spawned. Note: the plug-in only ensures that the <i>log</i> of the
            tree will be in one of the allowed biomes, but the leaves may be placed in another biome if the log is
            very close to another biome.
        </p>
        <h3>Allowed terrain</h3>
        <p>
            The blocks on which the tree can be spawned. Note 1: when using a tree whose log is wider than 1 block,
            only 1 of the root log blocks needs to be above allowed terrain. Note 2: in minecraft 1.17 and earlier,
            Spigot will ensure that trees can <b>not</b> be spawned on unnatural terrain (for instance, they won't
            grow on stone or water). Including stone or water in the allowed terrain will <b>not</b> change this.
            In minecraft 1.18 and later, Spigot is much less strict and even allows you to spawn trees on top of the
            ocean (at least, if you add <i>Water</i> to the allowed terrain).
        </p>
        <h3>Log material</h3>
        <p>
            The block(s) that will be used to create the <i>log</i> of the tree.
        </p>
        <h3>Leaves material</h3>
        <p>
            The block(s) that will be used to create the <i>leaves</i> of the tree. If the <i>tree shape</i>
            doesn't have leaves, this will be ignored.
        </p>
        <h3>Chance</h3>
        <p>
            For each chunk, this is the chance that this generator will <b>not</b> skip the chunk.
        </p>
        <h3>Minimum/maximum number of trees/attempts</h3>
        <p>
            These properties determine how many trees the generator will spawn on each chunk. For each chunk, the
            generator will determine the <i>desired</i> number of trees, which will be a random integer between
            the <i>minimum</i> number of trees and the <i>maximum</i> number of trees. The generator will keep
            doing tree spawn <i>attempts</i> until it has either spawned the <i>desired</i> number of trees or
            has reached the maximum number of <i>attempts</i>. In each attempt, the generator will pick a random
            X-coordinate and a random Z-coordinate, and attempt to place a tree on top of the highest non-empty block
            at these coordinates. The attempt will fail if:
        </p>
        <ul>
            <li>The highest block is not the right block. (For instance, no trees can be spawned on top of stone.)</li>
            <li>There is no space for the tree. (For instance, there is a house or another tree nearby.)</li>
            <li>The location is not in one of the <i>Allowed biomes</i>.</li>
            <li>Maybe there are other causes of which I'm not aware.</li>
        </ul>
