            The allowed worlds menu can be used to specify in which worlds custom ore veins and custom trees
            can be generated. By default, all worlds are allowed, and it should look like this:
        </p>
        <img src="allowed worlds all.png" width="50%" />
        <p>
            By clicking on the <i>Add</i> button, you can create new text fields in which you can type the
            names of the allowed worlds. If you add at least 1 text field, the ores/trees can only be generated
            in a world with one of the specified names. For instance, if you only want them to be generated in
            the default overworld (which is normally called just "world"), you should do this:
        </p>
        <img src="allowed worlds limited.png" width="50%" />
        <h3>World names</h3>
        <p>
            By default, the name of the overworld is "world", the name of the nether is "world_nether", and the name
            of The End is "world_the_end". If you add more worlds to your server (for instance using plug-ins such
            as Multiverse), you typically need to choose a name for that world, which you can type in the
            text fields here.
