        <p>
            The file chooser menu allows you to select files from your computer and send them to the editor.
            It should look a bit like this (depends on which files are on your computer):
        </p>
        <img src="filechooser.png" width="50%" />
        <p>
            Due to programming decissions I made in the beginning that might not have been excellent, I had to write
            my own (ugly) file chooser menu. Anyway, it works well and wasn't much work, so it's fine.
        </p>
        <p>
            The file chooser menu lists all directories and <b>relevant</b> files in the directory it is currently viewing.
            If there are too many files to fit on the screen, you can scroll down with the mouse wheel or arrow keys.
            A file is considered relevant if it has the right file extension (for instance .png for images).
            Clicking on the name of a directory will view that directory instead of the current one.
            Clickong on 'Go up' will view the parent directory of the currently viewed directory.
            Clicking on any regular file will cause a 'Select' button to be shown.
            clicking on that 'Select' button will select the file you last clicked on and go back to whatever menu
            you opened the file chooser from.
            Clicking on the 'Cancel' button will bring you back to the menu from which you opened the file chooser,
            but without selecting a file.
        </p>
        <p>
            When opening the file chooser, it will initially view the directory in which the editor (Editor.jar, the one you double clicked)
            is located. Therefore, I recommend putting the editor close to or in the same folder as your images to make things go nice
            and fast.
