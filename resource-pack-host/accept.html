        <p>
            You're probably visiting this page because a server kicked you because 'you' rejected their server resource pack.
            Except that... you didn't reject anything. If this is the case for you, your minecraft settings are probably
            rejecting all server resource packs automatically, without asking anything to you. The following 2 screenshots
            show how you can change these settings:
        </p>
        <img src="accept1.png" width="30%" />
        <img src="accept2.png" width="30%" />
        <p>
            To avoid this problem, make sure that server resource packs for the server you're visiting are either
            <b>Enabled</b> or <b>Prompt</b>, preferably <b>Enabled</b>.
        </p>
        <ul>
            <li>If you choose <b>Enabled</b>, you will automatically accept all server resource packs.</li>
            <li>
                If you choose <b>Prompt</b>, you <i>should</i> be able to choose whether to accept the server 
                resource pack. However, this does not seem to always work properly, so I would not recommend it.
